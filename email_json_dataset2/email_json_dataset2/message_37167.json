When \u00c2nanda was going from Magadha to Vais\u00e2l\u00ee, wishing his pari-nirv\u00e2na to take place there, the devas informed king Aj\u00e2tasatru [1] of it, and the king immediately pursued him, in his own grand carriage, with a body of soldiers, and had reached the river. On the other hand, the Lichchhavis of Vais\u00e2l\u00ee had heard that \u00c2nanda was coming to their city, and they on their part came to meet him. In this way, they all arrived together at the river, and \u00c2nanda considered that, if he went forward, king Aj\u00e2tasatru would be very angry, while, if he went back, the Lichchhavis would resent his conduct. He thereupon in the very middle of the river burnt his body in a fiery ecstasy of Sam\u00e2dhi [2], and his pari-nirv\u00e2na was attained. He divided his body into two parts, leaving one part on each bank; so that each of the two kings got one part as a sacred relic, and took it back to his own capital, and there raised a tope over it."}
