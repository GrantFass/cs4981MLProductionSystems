The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, I cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' I do not know whether this incident occurred.\""}
