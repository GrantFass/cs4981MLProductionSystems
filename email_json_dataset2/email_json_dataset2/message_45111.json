For if an inward assent of the mind to all the Doctrines concerning Christian Faith now taught, (whereof the greatest part are disputed,) were necessary to Salvation, there would be nothing in the world so hard, as to be a Christian. The Thief upon the Crosse though repenting, could not have been saved for saying, \"Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome;\" by which he testified no beleefe of any other Article, but this, That Jesus Was The King. Nor could it bee said (as it is Mat. 11. 30.) that \"Christs yoke is Easy, and his burthen Light:\" Nor that \"Little Children beleeve in him,\" as it is Matth. 18.6. Nor could St. Paul have said (1 Cor. 1. 21.) \"It pleased God by the Foolishnesse of preaching, to save them that beleeve:\" Nor could St. Paul himself have been saved, much lesse have been so great a Doctor of the Church so suddenly, that never perhaps thought of Transsubstantiation, nor Purgatory, nor many other Articles now obtruded."}
