The people all use the language of Central India, \"Central India\" being what we should call the \"Middle Kingdom.\" The food and clothes of the common people are the same as in that Central Kingdom. The Law of Buddha is very flourishing in Woo-chang. They call the places where the monks stay for a time or reside permanently Sangh\u00e2r\u00e2mas; and of these there are in all five hundred, the monks being all students of the h\u00eenay\u00e2na. When stranger bhikshus [1] arrive at one of them, their wants are supplied for three days, after which they are told to find a resting-place for themselves."}
