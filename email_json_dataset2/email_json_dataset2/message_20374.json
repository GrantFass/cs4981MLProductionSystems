Domitius was pr\u00e6tor in Sicily, a slave killed a wild boar of extraordinary size. The pr\u00e6tor, struck by the dexterity and courage of the man, desired to see him. The poor wretch, highly gratified with the distinction, came to present himself before the pr\u00e6tor, in hopes, no doubt, of praise and reward; but Domitius, on learning that he had only a javelin to attack and kill the boar, ordered him to be instantly crucified, under the barbarous pretext that the law prohibited the use of this weapon, as of all others, to slaves.\u201d Perhaps the cruelty of Domitius is less astonishing than the indifference with which the Roman orator relates this circumstance, which affects him so little that he thus expresses himself: \u201cDurum hoc fortasse videatur, neque ego in ullam partem disputo.\u201d \u201cThis may appear harsh, nor do I give any opinion on the subject.\u201d And it is the same orator who exclaims in the same oration, \u201cFacinus est cruciare civem Romanum; scelus verberare; prope parricidium necare: quid dicam in crucem tollere?\u201d \u201cIt is a crime to imprison a Roman citizen; wickedness to scourge; next to parricide to put to death, what shall I call it to crucify?\u201d"}
