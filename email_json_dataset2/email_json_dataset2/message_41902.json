JUNI STARTET DIE RALLYE!", "body": " Three or four li east from this place there is a tope commemorating the following occurrence: A hundred years after the pari-nirv\u00e2na of Buddha, some Bhikshus of Vais\u00e2l\u00ee went wrong in the matter of the disciplinary rules in ten particulars, and appealed for their justification to what they said were the words of Buddha. Hereupon the Arhats and Bhikshus observant of the rules, to the number in all of seven hundred monks, examined afresh and collated the collection of disciplinary books [5]. Subsequently men built at this place the tope in question, which is still existing."}
