And now the question arises\u2014inasmuch as these categories are not derived from nature, and do not regulate themselves according to her as their model (for in that case they would be empirical)\u2014how it is conceivable that nature must regulate herself according to them, in other words, how the categories can determine \u00e0 priori the synthesis of the manifold of nature, and yet not derive their origin from her. The following is the solution of this enigma."}
