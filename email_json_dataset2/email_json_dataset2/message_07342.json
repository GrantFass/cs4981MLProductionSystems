Why did we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this and, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or of falling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in the first case, the empirical conception is always too small for the idea, and in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of these contradictions to the empirical regress? The reason is this. Possible experience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it a conception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object. Hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we are to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction of thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world. If we say of a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too small, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter, and requiring to be adapted to it. Among the trivial subjects of discussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question: \u201cIf a ball cannot pass through a hole, shall we say that the ball is too large or the hole too small?\u201d In this case it is indifferent what expression we employ; for we do not know which exists for the sake of the other. On the other hand, we cannot say: \u201cThe man is too long for his coat\u201d; but: \u201cThe coat is too short for the man.\u201d"}
