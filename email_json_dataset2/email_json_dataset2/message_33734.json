The Segestans [_Sacasten\u008f. St. Martin._] inhabited a large and level country, which still preserves their name, to the south of Khorasan, and the west of Hindostan. (See Geographia Nubiensis. p. 133, and D\u00d5Herbelot, Biblioth\u008fque Orientale, p. 797.) Notwithstanding the boasted victory of Bahram, (vol. i. p. 410,) the Segestans, above fourscore years afterwards, appear as an independent nation, the ally of Persia. We are ignorant of the situation of the Vert\u00be and Chionites, but I am inclined to place them (at least the latter) towards the confines of India and Scythia. See Ammian. \u00d1\u00d1Klaproth considers the real Albanians the same with the ancient Alani, and quotes a passage of the emperor Julian in support of his opinion. They are the Osset\u00be, now inhabiting part of Caucasus. Tableaux Hist. de l\u00d5Asie, p. 179, 180.\u00d1M. \u00d1\u00d1The Vert\u00be are still unknown. It is possible that the Chionites are the same as the Huns. These people were already known; and we find from Armenian authors that they were making, at this period, incursions into Asia. They were often at war with the Persians. The name was perhaps pronounced differently in the East and in the West, and this prevents us from recognizing it. St. Martin, ii. 177.\u00d1M.]"}
