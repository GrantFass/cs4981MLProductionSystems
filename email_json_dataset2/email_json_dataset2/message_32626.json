There are, however, pure principles \u00e0 priori, which nevertheless I should not ascribe to the pure understanding\u2014for this reason, that they are not derived from pure conceptions, but (although by the mediation of the understanding) from pure intuitions. But understanding is the faculty of conceptions. Such principles mathematical science possesses, but their application to experience, consequently their objective validity, nay the possibility of such \u00e0 priori synthetical cognitions (the deduction thereof) rests entirely upon the pure understanding."}
