Cassiodorus himself was first the treasurer of the private expenditure to Odoacer, afterwards \u201ccount of the sacred largesses.\u201d Yielding with the rest of the Romans to the dominion of Theodoric, he was instrumental in the peaceable submission of Sicily; was successively governor of his native provinces of Bruttium and Lucania, quaestor, magister, palatii, Praetorian pr\u00e6fect, patrician, consul, and private secretary, and, in fact, first minister of the king. He was five times Praetorian pr\u00e6fect under different sovereigns, the last time in the reign of Vitiges. This is the theory of Manso, which is not unencumbered with difficulties. M. Buat had supposed that it was the father of Cassiodorus who held the office first named. Compare Manso, p. 85, &c., and Beylage, vii. It certainly appears improbable that Cassiodorus should have been count of the sacred largesses at twenty years old.\u2014M.]"}
