He requested that the power might be equally divided between them; the army would not listen to his speech. He consented to be degraded to the rank of C\u00e6sar; the favor was refused him. He desired, at least, he might be appointed Pr\u00e6torian pr\u00e6fect; his prayer was rejected. Finally, he pleaded for his life. The army, in these several judgments, exercised the supreme magistracy.\u201d According to the historian, whose doubtful narrative the President De Montesquieu has adopted, Philip, who, during the whole transaction, had preserved a sullen silence, was inclined to spare the innocent life of his benefactor; till, recollecting that his innocence might excite a dangerous compassion in the Roman world, he commanded, without regard to his suppliant cries, that he should be seized, stripped, and led away to instant death. After a moment\u2019s pause, the inhuman sentence was executed. 55"}
