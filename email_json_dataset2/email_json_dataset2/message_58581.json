It is this: \u201cIt is impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time.\u201d Not to mention the superfluousness of the addition of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty, which ought to be self-evident from the proposition itself, the proposition is affected by the condition of time, and as it were says: \u201cA thing = A, which is something = B, cannot at the same time be non-B.\u201d But both, B as well as non-B, may quite well exist in succession. For example, a man who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man can very well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old. Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must not by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, and consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true purpose. The misunderstanding arises in this way. We first of all separate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing, and afterwards connect with this predicate its opposite, and hence do not establish any contradiction with the subject, but only with its predicate, which has been conjoined with the subject synthetically\u2014a contradiction, moreover, which obtains only when the first and second predicate are affirmed in the same time. If I say: \u201cA man who is ignorant is not learned,\u201d the condition \u201cat the same time\u201d must be added, for he who is at one time ignorant, may at another be learned. But if I say: \u201cNo ignorant man is a learned man,\u201d the proposition is analytical, because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent part of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negative proposition is evident immediately from the proposition of contradiction, without the necessity of adding the condition \u201cthe same time.\u201d This is the reason why I have altered the formula of this principle\u2014an alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an analytical proposition."}
