A perfect number (Greek), as already stated, is one which is equal to the sum of its divisors. Thus 6, which is the first perfect or cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. The words (Greek), \u2018terms\u2019 or \u2018notes,\u2019 and (Greek), \u2018intervals,\u2019 are applicable to music as well as to number and figure. (Greek) is the \u2018base\u2019 on which the whole calculation depends, or the \u2018lowest term\u2019 from which it can be worked out. The words (Greek) have been variously translated\u2014\u2018squared and cubed\u2019 (Donaldson), \u2018equalling and equalled in power\u2019 (Weber), \u2018by involution and evolution,\u2019 i.e. by raising the power and extracting the root (as in the translation). Numbers are called \u2018like and unlike\u2019 (Greek) when the factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent are or are not in the same ratio: e.g. 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed; and conversely. \u2018Waxing\u2019 (Greek) numbers, called also \u2018increasing\u2019 (Greek), are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors: e.g. 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. \u2018Waning\u2019 (Greek) numbers, called also \u2018decreasing\u2019 (Greek) are those which succeed the sum of their divisors: e.g. 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. The words translated \u2018commensurable and agreeable to one another\u2019 (Greek) seem to be different ways of describing the same relation, with more or less precision. They are equivalent to \u2018expressible in terms having the same relation to one another,\u2019 like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of which numbers is in the relation of (1 and 1/2) to the preceding. The \u2018base,\u2019 or \u2018fundamental number, which has 1/3 added to it\u2019 (1 and 1/3) = 4/3 or a musical fourth. (Greek) is a \u2018proportion\u2019 of numbers as of musical notes, applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to the relation of one number to another. The first harmony is a \u2018square\u2019 number (Greek); the second harmony is an \u2018oblong\u2019 number (Greek), i.e. a number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are equal. (Greek) = \u2018numbers squared from\u2019 or \u2018upon diameters\u2019; (Greek) = \u2018rational,\u2019 i.e. omitting fractions, (Greek), \u2018irrational,\u2019 i.e. including fractions; e.g. 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the same. For several of the explanations here given and for a good deal besides I am indebted to an excellent article on the Platonic Number by Dr. Donaldson (Proc. of the Philol. Society)."}
