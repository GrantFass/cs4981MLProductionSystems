When he, too, settled in Brussels in the spring of 1845, we decided to work out together the contrast between our view and the idealism of the German philosophy, in fact to settle our accounts with our former philosophic conscience. The plan was carried out in the form of a criticism of the post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript in two solid octavo volumes had long reached the publisher in Westphalia, when we received information that conditions had so changed as not to allow of its publication. We abandoned the manuscript to the stinging criticism of the mice the more readily since we had accomplished our main purpose\u2015the clearing up of the question to ourselves. Of the scattered writings on various subjects in which we presented our views to the public at that time, I recall only the \u201cManifesto of the Communist Party\u201d written by Engels and myself, and the \u201cDiscourse on Free Trade\u201d written by myself. The leading points of our theory were first presented scientifically, though in a polemic form, in my \u201cMis\u00e8re de la Philosophie, etc.\u201d directed against Proudhon and published in 1847. An essay on \u201cWage Labor,\u201d written by me in German, and in which I put together my lectures on the subject delivered before the German Workmen\u2019s Club at Brussels, was prevented from leaving the hands of the printer by the February revolution and my expulsion from Belgium which followed it as a consequence."}
