As this period is believed to extend far beyond the usual duration of human life, such persons are called, and popularly believed to be, immortals.\" Rishis are divided into various classes; and rishi-ism is spoken of as a seventh path of transrotation, and rishis are referred to as the seventh class of sentient beings.]"}
