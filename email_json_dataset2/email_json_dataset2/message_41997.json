Wild swine copulate at the beginning of winter. They produce their young in the spring. For this purpose the female gets away into inaccessible and precipitous places, where there are caves and plenty of shade. The males remain with the females for thirty days. The number of pigs and the period of gestation are the same as in the domesticated herd, and their voices are much alike: the female, however, grunts more and the male less. The castration of the male makes them larger and more fierce, as Homer writes. \"He brought up a castrated wild boar, which was not like a beast fed upon food, but resembled a woody mountain peak.\" Castration takes place from a disease like a swelling in the testicles, which they rub against the trees and so destroy them."}
