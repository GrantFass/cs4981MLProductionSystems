The science of natural philosophy (physics) contains in itself synthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, as principles. I shall adduce two propositions. For instance, the proposition, \u201cIn all changes of the material world, the quantity of matter remains unchanged\u201d; or, that, \u201cIn all communication of motion, action and reaction must always be equal.\u201d In both of these, not only is the necessity, and therefore their origin \u00e0 priori clear, but also that they are synthetical propositions. For in the conception of matter, I do not cogitate its permanency, but merely its presence in space, which it fills. I therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter, in order to think on to it something \u00e0 priori, which I did not think in it. The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, and nevertheless conceived \u00e0 priori; and so it is with regard to the other propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy."}
