[4] A month after the annual season of rest, the families which are looking out for blessing stimulate one another to make offerings to the monks, and send round to them the liquid food which may be taken out of the ordinary hours. All the monks come together in a great assembly, and preach the Law; after which offerings are presented at the tope of S\u00e2riputtra, with all kinds of flowers and incense. All through the night lamps are kept burning, and skilful musicians are employed to perform."}
