Hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of conditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reason\u2014at least as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned. They may have no valid application, corresponding to their transcendental employment, in concreto, and be thus of no greater utility than to direct the understanding how, while extending them as widely as possible, to maintain its exercise and application in perfect consistence and harmony."}
