It is my duty to report this to his Majesty, who has retired to his western palace. Here I must enter. [_Perceiving the Emperor._] I report to your Majesty that Hanchenyu, the leader of the northern foreigners, sends an envoy to declare that Maouyenshow has presented to him the portrait of the princess, and that he demands her in marriage as the only condition of peace. If refused, he will invade the South with a great power, and our rivers and hills will be exposed to rapine."}
