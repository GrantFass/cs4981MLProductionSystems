Euseb. Hist. Eccles. Liv. c. 15 * Note: The 15th chapter of the 10th book of the Eccles. History of Eusebius treats principally of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp, and mentions some other martyrs. A single example of weakness is related; it is that of a Phrygian named Quintus, who, appalled at the sight of the wild beasts and the tortures, renounced his faith. This example proves little against the mass of Christians, and this chapter of Eusebius furnished much stronger evidence of their courage than of their timidity.\u00d1G\u00d1\u00d1This Quintus had, however, rashly and of his own accord appeared before the tribunal; and the church of Smyrna condemn \u00d2_his indiscreet ardor_,\u00d3 coupled as it was with weakness in the hour of trial.\u00d1M.]"}
