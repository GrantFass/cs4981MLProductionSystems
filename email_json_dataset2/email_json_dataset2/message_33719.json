In the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so that nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of phenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford \u00e0 priori. From this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge \u00e0 priori, namely, space and time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed."}
