Some partial order may have been issued by the Eastern emperor; but the idea of any general law is contradicted by the silence of the Code, and the evidence of ecclesiastical history. Note: See in Reiske\u2019s edition of Libanius, tom. ii. p. 155. Sacrific was prohibited by Valens, but not the offering of incense.\u2014M.]"}
