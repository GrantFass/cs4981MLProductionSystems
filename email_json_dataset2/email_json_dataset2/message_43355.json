There are two monasteries in it, the inmates of which are students of the hinay\u00e2na. At a distance from the city of six or seven li, on the west, on the northern bank of the Ganges, is a place where Buddha preached the Law to his disciples. It has been handed down that his subjects of discourse were such as \"The bitterness and vanity of life as impermanent and uncertain,\" and that \"The body is as a bubble or foam on the water.\" At this spot a tope was erected, and still exists."}
