There are other birds which live upon fruit and grasses, as the phaps, phatta, peristera, \u0153nas, and trygon.[216] The phatta and peristera are always present, the trygon only in summer time; in the winter it is not seen, for it hides itself in holes. The \u0153nas is generally seen and captured in the autumn. The \u0153nas is as large as the peristera but less than the phaps. It is generally captured as it is drinking; it comes to this country when it has young. All the rest come in the summer, and make their nests here, and all, except the pigeon tribe, live upon animal food."}
