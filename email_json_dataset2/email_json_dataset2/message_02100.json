For it may mean: \"We represent something to ourselves as good, when and because we desire (will) it\"; or \"We desire something because we represent it to ourselves as good,\" so that either the desire determines the notion of the object as a good, or the notion of good determines the desire (the will); so that in the first case sub ratione boni would mean, \"We will something under the idea of the good\"; in the second, \"In consequence of this idea,\" which, as determining the volition, must precede it."}
