In those apodal creatures which are outwardly viviparous and inwardly oviparous, as the sharks and selachea--[The selachea are apodal, furnished with gills, and viviparous]--the uterus is divided, and as in birds, it commences below and extends towards the diaphragm. The ova are situated between the division, and above near the diaphragm; and the animal is produced from the ovum after this has descended into the open space."}
