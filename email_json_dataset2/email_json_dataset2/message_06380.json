It seems to be found first, rather vaguely, in Richard Hooker's _Ecclesiastical Polity_, from which Locke largely borrowed: and it reappears, in varying forms, in Milton's _Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_, in Hobbes's _Leviathan_, in Locke's _Treatises on Civil Government_, and in Rousseau. The best-known instance of its actual use is by the Pilgrim Fathers on the _Mayflower_ in 1620, in whose declaration occurs the phrase, \"We do solemnly and mutually, in the presence of God and of one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic.\" The natural implication of this view would seem to be the corollary of complete popular Sovereignty which Rousseau draws. But before Rousseau's time it had been used to support views as diverse as those which rested on the first form. We saw that, in Grotius's great work, _De Jure Belli et Pacis_, it was already possible to doubt which of the two theories was being advocated. The first theory was, historically, a means of popular protest against royal aggression. As soon as popular government was taken into account, the act of contract between people and government became in effect merely a contract between the individuals composing the society, and readily passed over into the second form."}
