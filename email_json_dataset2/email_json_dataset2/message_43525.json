Peter, is subject to question: For though the Canonicall books bee there reckoned up; yet these words, \"Sint vobis omnibus Clericis & Laicis Libris venerandi, &c.\" containe a distinction of Clergy, and Laity, that was not in use so neer St. Peters time. The first Councell for setling the Canonicall Scripture, that is extant, is that of Laodicea, Can. 59. which forbids the reading of other Books then those in the Churches; which is a Mandate that is not addressed to every Christian, but to those onely that had authority to read any publiquely in the Church; that is, to Ecclesiastiques onely."}
