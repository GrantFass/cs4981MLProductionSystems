But the regress itself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmical quantity, and cannot therefore give us any determined conception of it\u2014still less a conception of a quantity which is, in relation to a certain standard, infinite. The regress does not, therefore, proceed to infinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for or the of presenting to us a quantity\u2014realized only in and through the regress itself."}
