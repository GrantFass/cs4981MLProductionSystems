Reason, as observed in the syllogistic process, is not applicable to intuitions, for the purpose of subjecting them to rules\u2014for this is the province of the understanding with its categories\u2014but to conceptions and judgements. If pure reason does apply to objects and the intuition of them, it does so not immediately, but mediately\u2014through the understanding and its judgements, which have a direct relation to the senses and their intuition, for the purpose of determining their objects. The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible experience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is that of the understanding. That everything which happens has a cause, is not a principle cognized and prescribed by reason. This principle makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason, which, without a reference to possible experience, could never have produced by means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity."}
