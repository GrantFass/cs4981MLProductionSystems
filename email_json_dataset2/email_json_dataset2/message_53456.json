Reason is present and the same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itself exist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it did not formerly exist. It is, relatively to new states or conditions, determining, but not determinable. Hence we cannot ask: \u201cWhy did not reason determine itself in a different manner?\u201d The question ought to be thus stated: \u201cWhy did not reason employ its power of causality to determine certain phenomena in a different manner?\u201d But this is a question which admits of no answer. For a different intelligible character would have exhibited a different empirical character; and, when we say that, in spite of the course which his whole former life has taken, the offender could have refrained from uttering the falsehood, this means merely that the act was subject to the power and authority\u2014permissive or prohibitive\u2014of reason. Now, reason is not subject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time; and a difference in time may produce a difference in the relation of phenomena to each other\u2014for these are not things and therefore not causes in themselves\u2014but it cannot produce any difference in the relation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason."}
