Scite enim istud et dicitur et dicetur, Id quod utile sit honestum esse, quod autem inutile sit turpe esse. [De Rep lib v p 457 ex edit Ser]. And this maxim will admit of no doubt, where public utility is concerned, which is Plato's meaning. And indeed to what other purpose do all the ideas of chastity and modesty serve? \"Nisi utile est quod facimus, frustra est gloria,\" says Phaedrus. [Greek quotation here], says Plutarch, de vitioso pudore. \"Nihil eorum quae damnosa sunt, pulchrum est.\" The same was the opinion of the Stoics [Greek quotation here; from Sept. Emp lib III cap 20]."}
