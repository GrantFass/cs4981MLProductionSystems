The question as to the possibility of it would stand thus: \u201cHave we an internal sense, but no external sense, and is our belief in external perception a mere delusion?\u201d But it is evident that, in order merely to fancy to ourselves anything as external, that is, to present it to the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense, and must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an external intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act of imagination. For merely to imagine also an external sense, would annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined by the imagination."}
