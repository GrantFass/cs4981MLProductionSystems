We learn that his book was called \u1f29\u03b4\u03c5\u03c0\u1f71\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, not only from the testimony of Athen\u00e6us, but from an imitation by Ennius. For Ennius, who died A.U.C. 584, one hundred and fifty-two years after the death of Aristotle, translated and in part imitated the poem of Archestratus, and called his work \"Carmina Hedypathetica,\" as Apulegius tells us in his \"Apologia.\" We have good reason for supposing that Archestratus was either contemporary with Aristotle, or a little older. For Archestratus mentions Diodorus Aspendius, the Pythagorean, as his contemporary, to whom Tim\u00e6us, the historian, tells us that the Epistle of Stratonicus was written (\"Athen\u00e6us,\" iv. p. 136). Therefore Archestratus, Diodorus, Aspendius, and Stratonicus, an eminent harpist, were contemporaries, and so they were with Aristotle and Demosthenes; and this conjecture is confirmed by many passages in Athen\u00e6us, where Stratonicus is reported to have been alive with those persons whom Demosthenes mentions in his orations. Aristotle, therefore, may have used this work of Archestratus in that part of his Natural History which treats of the nature of fishes.[230]"}
