There are therefore certain laws (which are moreover \u00e0 priori) which make nature possible; and all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience, and by virtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomes possible. The purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to us the unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certain exponents, the only business of which is to express the relation of time (in so far as it contains all existence in itself) to the unity of apperception, which can exist in synthesis only according to rules. The combined expression of all is this: \u201cAll phenomena exist in one nature, and must so exist, inasmuch as without this \u00e0 priori unity, no unity of experience, and consequently no determination of objects in experience, is possible.\u201d"}
