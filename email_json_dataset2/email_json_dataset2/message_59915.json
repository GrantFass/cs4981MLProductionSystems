Yet we are assured that the great-grandfather of Hugh Capet was Robert the Strong count of Anjou, (A.D. 863\u2014873,) a noble Frank of Neustria, Neustricus... generos\u00e6 stirpis, who was slain in the defence of his country against the Normans, dum patri\u00e6 fines tuebatur. Beyond Robert, all is conjecture or fable. It is a probable conjecture, that the third race descended from the second by Childebrand, the brother of Charles Martel. It is an absurd fable that the second was allied to the first by the marriage of Ansbert, a Roman senator and the ancestor of St. Arnoul, with Blitilde, a daughter of Clotaire I. The Saxon origin of the house of France is an ancient but incredible opinion. See a judicious memoir of M. de Foncemagne, (M\u00e9moires de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 548\u2014579.) He had promised to declare his own opinion in a second memoir, which has never appeared.]"}
