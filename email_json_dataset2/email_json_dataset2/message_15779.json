The former is termed philosophical, the latter mathematical. I have already shown the essential difference of these two methods of cognition in the first chapter. A cognition may be objectively philosophical and subjectively historical\u2014as is the case with the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the limits of their system, and who remain in a state of pupilage all their lives. But it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge, when committed to memory, is valid, from the subjective point of view, as rational knowledge also, and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here as in the case of philosophical cognition. The reason is that the only way of arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles of reason, and thus it is always certain and indisputable; because reason is employed in concreto\u2014but at the same time \u00e0 priori\u2014that is, in pure and, therefore, infallible intuition; and thus all causes of illusion and error are excluded. Of all the \u00e0 priori sciences of reason, therefore, mathematics alone can be learned. Philosophy\u2014unless it be in an historical manner\u2014cannot be learned; we can at most learn to philosophize."}
