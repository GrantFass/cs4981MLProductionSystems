For this reason its condition cannot be regarded as absolutely necessary, but merely as relatively necessary, or rather as needful; the condition is in itself and \u00e0 priori a mere arbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition, by reason, of the conditioned. If, then, we are to possess a theoretical cognition of the absolute necessity of a thing, we cannot attain to this cognition otherwise than \u00e0 priori by means of conceptions; while it is impossible in this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any relation to an existence given in experience."}
