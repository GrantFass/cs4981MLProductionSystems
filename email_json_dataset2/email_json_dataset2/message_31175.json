Gainar, the Lombard prince of Salerno wished to retain them in his service and take them into his pay. They answered, \u201cWe fight for our religion, and not for money.\u201d Gaimar entreated them to send some Norman knights to his court. This seems to have been the origin of the connection of the Normans with Italy. See Histoire des Conquetes des Normands par Goutier d\u2019Arc, l. i. c. i., Paris, 1830.\u2014M.]"}
