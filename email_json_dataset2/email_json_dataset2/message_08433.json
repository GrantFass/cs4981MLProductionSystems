The nature of the testacea is the same as that of creatures without shells, as the cnid\u00e6[166] and sponges, which inhabit the holes in rocks. There are two kinds of cnid\u00e6, some which live in holes in the rocks, and cannot be separated from them, and other migrating species which live upon the smooth flat surface of the rocks. (The patella also is free and locomotive.) In the interior of the sponges are found the creatures called pinnophylaces, and the interior is closed with a net like a spider's web, and small fish are captured by opening and closing this web, for it opens as they approach, and closes upon them when they have entered."}
