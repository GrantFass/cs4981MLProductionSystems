But space and time are not merely forms of sensuous intuition, but intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), and therefore contain \u00e0 priori the determination of the unity of this manifold.[23] (See the Transcendent \u00c6sthetic.) Therefore is unity of the synthesis of the manifold without or within us, consequently also a conjunction to which all that is to be represented as determined in space or time must correspond, given \u00e0 priori along with (not in) these intuitions, as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of them. But this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the conjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general, in a primitive act of consciousness, according to the categories, but applied to our sensuous intuition. Consequently all synthesis, whereby alone is even perception possible, is subject to the categories. And, as experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions, the categories are conditions of the possibility of experience and are therefore valid \u00e0 priori for all objects of experience."}
