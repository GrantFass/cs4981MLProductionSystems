The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to exclaim, in his barbarous idiom, \u201cWho is this rustic, that keeps his seat, while so many valiant captains are standing round him?\u201d The emperor maintained his silence, dissembled his indignation, and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of the words, which he partly suspected from the universal language of gesture and countenance. Before the departure of the pilgrims, he endeavored to learn the name and condition of the audacious baron. \u201cI am a Frenchman,\u201d replied Robert, \u201cof the purest and most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that there is a church in my neighborhood, 72 the resort of those who are desirous of approving their valor in single combat. Till an enemy appears, they address their prayers to God and his saints. That church I have frequently visited. But never have I found an antagonist who dared to accept my defiance.\u201d Alexius dismissed the challenger with some prudent advice for his conduct in the Turkish warfare; and history repeats with pleasure this lively example of the manners of his age and country."}
