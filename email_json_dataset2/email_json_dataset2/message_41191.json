It is treated with more judgment and propriety by Censorinus (de Die Natali, c. 20) and Macrobius, (Saturnal. i. c. 12-16.) The appellation of _Bissextile_, which marks the inauspicious year, (Augustin. ad Januarium, Epist. 119,) is derived from the _repetition_ of the _sixth_ day of the calends of March.]"}
