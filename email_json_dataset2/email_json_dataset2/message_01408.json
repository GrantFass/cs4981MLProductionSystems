Hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from the proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d as Descartes maintained\u2014because in this case the major premiss, \u201cEverything, which thinks, exists,\u201d must precede\u2014but the two propositions are identical. The proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d expresses an undetermined empirical intuition, that perception (proving consequently that sensation, which must belong to sensibility, lies at the foundation of this proposition); but it precedes experience, whose province it is to determine an object of perception by means of the categories in relation to time; and existence in this proposition is not a category, as it does not apply to an undetermined given object, but only to one of which we have a conception, and about which we wish to know whether it does or does not exist, out of, and apart from this conception. An undetermined perception signifies here merely something real that has been given, only, however, to thought in general\u2014but not as a phenomenon, nor as a thing in itself (noumenon), but only as something that really exists, and is designated as such in the proposition, \u201cI think.\u201d For it must be remarked that, when I call the proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d an empirical proposition, I do not thereby mean that the Ego in the proposition is an empirical representation; on the contrary, it is purely intellectual, because it belongs to thought in general. But without some empirical representation, which presents to the mind material for thought, the mental act, \u201cI think,\u201d would not take place; and the empirical is only the condition of the application or employment of the pure intellectual faculty."}
