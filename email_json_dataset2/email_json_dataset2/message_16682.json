Choose any love pi11 you want!", "body": " It has been a long-cherished wish\u2014that (who knows how late), may one day, be happily accomplished\u2014that the principles of the endless variety of civil laws should be investigated and exposed; for in this way alone can we find the secret of simplifying legislation. But in this case, laws are nothing more than limitations of our freedom upon conditions under which it subsists in perfect harmony with itself; they consequently have for their object that which is completely our own work, and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means of these conceptions. But how objects as things in themselves\u2014how the nature of things is subordinated to principles and is to be determined, according to conceptions, is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to answer. Be this, however, as it may\u2014for on this point our investigation is yet to be made\u2014it is at least manifest from what we have said that cognition from principles is something very different from cognition by means of the understanding, which may indeed precede other cognitions in the form of a principle, but in itself\u2014in so far as it is synthetical\u2014is neither based upon mere thought, nor contains a general proposition drawn from conceptions alone."}
