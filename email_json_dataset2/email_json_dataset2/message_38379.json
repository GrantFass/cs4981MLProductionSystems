De Guignes, (Histoire des Huns, tom. iii. p. 155-173,) and our countryman Colonel Alexander Dow, (vol. i. p. 23-83.) In the two first volumes of his History of Hindostan, he styles himself the translator of the Persian Ferishta; but in his florid text, it is not easy to distinguish the version and the original. * Note: The European reader now possesses a more accurate version of Ferishta, that of Col. Briggs. Of Col. Dow\u2019s work, Col. Briggs observes, \u201cthat the author\u2019s name will be handed down to posterity as one of the earliest and most indefatigable of our Oriental scholars. Instead of confining himself, however, to mere translation, he has filled his work with his own observations, which have been so embodied in the text that Gibbon declares it impossible to distinguish the translator from the original author.\u201d Preface p. vii.\u2014M.]"}
