Such are, the Proconsul Sergius Paulus, converted at Paphos, (Acts xiii. 7\u201412.) Dionysius, member of the Areopagus, converted with several others, al Athens, (Acts xvii. 34;) several persons at the court of Nero, (Philip. iv 22;) Erastus, receiver at Corinth, (Rom. xvi.23;) some Asiarchs, (Acts xix. 31) As to the philosophers, we may add Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, Hegesippus, Melito, Miltiades, Pant\u00e6nus, Ammenius, all distinguished for their genius and learning.\u2014G.]"}
