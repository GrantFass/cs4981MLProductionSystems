Money, he says, must be \u201cin constant motion, it can be money only by being mobile, but as soon as it becomes motionless all is lost.\u201d (\u201cDans un mouvement continuel, ce qui ne peut \u00eatre que tant qu\u2019il est meuble, mais sit\u00f4t qu\u2019il devient immeuble tout est perdu.\u201d \u201cLe D\u00e9tail de la France,\u201d p. 231.) What he overlooks is that this halt constitutes the condition of its movement. What he really wants is that the value form of commodities should appear merely in the transitory form of their change of matter, but should never become an end in itself."}
