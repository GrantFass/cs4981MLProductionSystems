The kings and people of the countries around vied with one another in their offerings, hanging up about it silken streamers and canopies, scattering flowers, burning incense, and lighting lamps, so as to make the night as bright as the day. This they did day after day without ceasing. It happened that a rat, carrying in its mouth the wick of a lamp, set one of the streamers or canopies on fire, which caught the vih\u00e2ra, and the seven stories were all consumed. The kings, with their officers and people, were all very sad and distressed, supposing that the sandalwood image had been burned; but lo! after four or five days, when the door of a small vih\u00e2ra on the east was opened, there was immediately seen the original image. They were all greatly rejoiced, and cooperated in restoring the vih\u00e2ra. When they had succeeded in completing two stories, they removed the image back to its former place."}
