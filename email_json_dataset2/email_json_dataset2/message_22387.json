But in transcendental logic it is the most important matter to be dealt with\u2014indeed the only one, if the question is of the possibility of synthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, the conditions and extent of their validity. For when this question is fully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, the determination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pure understanding."}
