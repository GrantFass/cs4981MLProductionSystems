It is safer then placing an order over the phone or even buying anything at retail stores.", "body": " It is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical reason. The first of the two propositions, \"That the endeavour after happiness produces a virtuous mind,\" is absolutely false; but the second, \"That a virtuous mind necessarily produces happiness,\" is not absolutely false, but only in so far as virtue is considered as a form of causality in the sensible world, and consequently only if I suppose existence in it to be the only sort of existence of a rational being; it is then only conditionally false. But as I am not only justified in thinking that I exist also as a noumenon in a world of the understanding, but even have in the moral law a purely intellectual determining principle of my causality (in the sensible world), it is not impossible that morality of mind should have a connection as cause with happiness (as an effect in the sensible world) if not immediate yet mediate (viz., through an intelligent author of nature), and moreover necessary; while in a system of nature which is merely an object of the senses, this combination could never occur except contingently and, therefore, could not suffice for the summum bonum."}
