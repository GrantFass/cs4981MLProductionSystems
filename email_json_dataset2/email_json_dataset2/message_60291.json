The wars, which he has described in the former volumes as glorious or necessary, are become unprofitable and wanton massacres; the buildings which he celebrated, as raised to the immortal honor of the great emperor, and his admirable queen, either as magnificent embellishments of the city, or useful fortifications for the defence of the frontier, are become works of vain prodigality and useless ostentation. I doubt whether Gibbon has made sufficient allowance for the \u201cmalignity\u201d of the Anecdota; at all events, the extreme and disgusting profligacy of Theodora\u2019s early life rests entirely on this viratent libel\u2014M.]"}
