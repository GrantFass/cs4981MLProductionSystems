The given judgement is the general rule (major). The subsumption of the condition of another possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the minor. The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rule in the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio). The rule predicates something generally under a certain condition. The condition of the rule is satisfied in some particular case. It follows that what was valid in general under that condition must also be considered as valid in the particular case which satisfies this condition. It is very plain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of the understanding which constitute a series of conditions. When I arrive at the proposition, \u201cAll bodies are changeable,\u201d by beginning with the more remote cognition (in which the conception of body does not appear, but which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception), \u201cAll compound is changeable,\u201d by proceeding from this to a less remote cognition, which stands under the condition of the former, \u201cBodies are compound,\u201d and hence to a third, which at length connects for me the remote cognition (changeable) with the one before me, \u201cConsequently, bodies are changeable\u201d\u2014I have arrived at a cognition (conclusion) through a series of conditions (premisses). Now every series, whose exponent (of the categorical or hypothetical judgement) is given, can be continued; consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us to the ratiocinatio polysyllogistica, which is a series of syllogisms, that can be continued either on the side of the conditions (per prosyllogismos) or of the conditioned (per episyllogismos) to an indefinite extent."}
