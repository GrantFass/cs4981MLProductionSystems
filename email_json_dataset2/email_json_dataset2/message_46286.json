In the exact sense, a tyrant is an individual who arrogates to himself the royal authority without having a right to it. This is how the Greeks understood the word \"tyrant\": they applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not legitimate.[2] _Tyrant_ and _usurper_ are thus perfectly synonymous terms."}
