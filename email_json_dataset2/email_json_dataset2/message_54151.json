Heind.) where mention is made of \"Mith\u00e6cus, the author of a work on Sicilian cookery, and Sarambus, the publican. One furnished the best of food, the other the best of wine.\" That the art of choosing and preparing food for the table was treated of in this book we may conclude from the use of the word \u1f41\u03c8\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u1fd3\u03b1, which the Greeks especially used to signify the kinds of fish used for food. A passage from this book on the manner of cooking the fish called tenia is quoted by Athen\u00e6us, who makes the title of this book \u1f40\u03c8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd, vii. p. 282, and xii. p. 506."}
