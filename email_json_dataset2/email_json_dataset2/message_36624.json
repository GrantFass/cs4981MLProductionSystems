When they brought the S\u00fbtras forth, three lofty seats had been prepared and grandly ornamented. S\u00e2riputtra occupied the one on the left, and Maudgaly\u00e2yana that on the right. Of the number of five hundred one was wanting. Mah\u00e2kasyapa was president on the middle seat. \u00c2nanda was then outside the door, and could not get in. At the place there was subsequently raised a tope, which is still existing."}
