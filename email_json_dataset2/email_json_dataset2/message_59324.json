If, as stated in the note quoted from Professor M\u00fcller, the emperor countenances both the T\u00e2oist worship and the Buddhist, he does so for reasons of state; to please especially his Buddhistic subjects in Thibet and Mongolia, and not to offend the many whose superstitious fancies incline to T\u00e2oism."}
