Some animals have a gall upon the liver, others none. Among viviparous quadrupeds the stag[62] has none, nor the deer,[63] horse, mule, ass, seal, and some swine. The Acha\u00efnian stag appears to have the gall in the tail; that which they call gall in these animals resembles it in colour, but it is not liquid like gall, but more like the spleen in its internal structure."}
