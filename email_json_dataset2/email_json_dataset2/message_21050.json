The neck is the part between the head and the trunk; the front part is called the larynx, behind this is the \u0153sophagus. The voice and the breath pass through the front part, the trachea, which is cartilaginous, but the \u0153sophagus is fleshy, and placed farther in, near the vertebra of the neck. The back of the neck is called the epomis. These are the parts as far as the thorax. The parts of the thorax are some before and some behind. First of all, below the neck is the breast with two mamm\u00e6; on these are two nipples, through which the milk of the female passes. The mamma is porous. There is also milk in the breasts of men. The flesh of the mamma in men is thick, in women it is spongy and full of pores."}
