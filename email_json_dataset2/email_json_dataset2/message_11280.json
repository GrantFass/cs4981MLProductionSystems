It is from magnitude that he derives the name of _Colosseum_, or _Coliseum_; since the same appellation was applied to the amphitheatre of Capua, without the aid of a colossal statue; since that of Nero was erected in the court (_in atrio_) of his palace, and not in the Coliseum, (P. iv. p. 15\u201419, l. i. c. 4.)]"}
