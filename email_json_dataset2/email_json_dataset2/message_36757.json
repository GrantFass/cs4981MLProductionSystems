Both modes have the properties of universality and an \u00e0 priori origin in common, but are, in their procedure, of widely different character. The reason of this is that in the world of phenomena, in which alone objects are presented to our minds, there are two main elements\u2014the form of intuition (space and time), which can be cognized and determined completely \u00e0 priori, and the matter or content\u2014that which is presented in space and time, and which, consequently, contains a something\u2014an existence corresponding to our powers of sensation. As regards the latter, which can never be given in a determinate mode except by experience, there are no \u00e0 priori notions which relate to it, except the undetermined conceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations, in so far as these belong (in a possible experience) to the unity of consciousness. As regards the former, we can determine our conceptions \u00e0 priori in intuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of the conceptions in space and time\u2014these objects being regarded simply as quanta. In the one case, reason proceeds according to conceptions and can do nothing more than subject phenomena to these\u2014which can only be determined empirically, that is, \u00e0 posteriori\u2014in conformity, however, with those conceptions as the rules of all empirical synthesis. In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction of conceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an \u00e0 priori intuition, they may be given and determined in pure intuition \u00e0 priori, and without the aid of empirical data. The examination and consideration of everything that exists in space or time\u2014whether it is a quantum or not, in how far the particular something (which fills space or time) is a primary substratum, or a mere determination of some other existence, whether it relates to anything else\u2014either as cause or effect, whether its existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and dependence upon others, the possibility of this existence, its reality and necessity or opposites\u2014all these form part of the cognition of reason on the ground of conceptions, and this cognition is termed philosophical. But to determine \u00e0 priori an intuition in space (its figure), to divide time into periods, or merely to cognize the quantity of an intuition in space and time, and to determine it by number\u2014all this is an operation of reason by means of the construction of conceptions, and is called mathematical."}
