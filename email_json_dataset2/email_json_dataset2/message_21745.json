P. p. 107\u2014126.) The superscription suggests a chronological remark, that John Pal\u00e6ologus II. was associated in the empire before the year 1414, the date of Chrysoloras\u2019s death. A still earlier date, at least 1408, is deduced from the age of his youngest sons, Demetrius and Thomas, who were both _Porphyrogeniti_ (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 244, 247.)]"}
