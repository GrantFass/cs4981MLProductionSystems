When this blood is diseased, it is called a flooding. Women have a less share in other diseases; but a few are afflicted with ixia, and with h\u00e6morrhoids and bleeding from the nose; when any of these take place, the catamenia decrease. The blood differs in proportion to the age in quantity and appearance, for when very young, it is more like serum, and very abundant; in the aged it is thick, black, and in less quantity; in those in the prime of life it is between these.

Serum is imperfect blood, because it has not ripened, or because it has become more fluid."}
