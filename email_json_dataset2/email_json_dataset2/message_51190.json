Flee thou 121 to the uttermost limits, Leaving thy home and the heights of the wheel-round city behind thee! Lo, there remaineth now nor the head nor the body in safety,--Neither the feet below nor the hands nor the middle are left thee,--All are destroyed 122 together; for fire and the passionate War-god, 123 Urging the Syrian 124 car to speed, doth hurl them 125 to ruin. Not thine alone, he shall cause many more great strongholds to perish, Yes, many temples of gods to the ravening fire shall deliver,--Temples which stand now surely with sweat of their terror down-streaming, Quaking with dread; and lo! from the topmost roof to the pavement Dark blood trickles, forecasting the dire unavoidable evil. Forth with you, forth from the shrine, and steep your soul in the sorrow!\" 126"}
