For this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but we cannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an object of the senses. I cannot say, \u201cThe regress from a given perception to everything limited either in space or time, proceeds in infinitum,\u201d for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity; neither can I say, \u201cIt is finite,\u201d for an absolute limit is likewise impossible in experience. It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertion at all respecting the whole object of experience\u2014the world of sense; I must limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or empirical knowledge is to be attained."}
