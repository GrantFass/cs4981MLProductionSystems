In the next place I subsume a cognition under the condition of the rule (and this is the minor) by means of the judgement. And finally I determine my cognition by means of the predicate of the rule (this is the conclusio), consequently, I determine it \u00e0 priori by means of the reason. The relations, therefore, which the major proposition, as the rule, represents between a cognition and its condition, constitute the different kinds of syllogisms. These are just threefold\u2014analogously with all judgements, in so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a cognition in the understanding\u2014namely, categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive."}
