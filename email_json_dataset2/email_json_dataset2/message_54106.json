Great", "body": " A fruit, small as the garden peach, May still be used for food. A State, though poor as ours, might thrive, If but its rule were good. Our rule is bad, our State is sad, With mournful heart I grieve. All can from instrument and voice My mood of mind perceive. Who know me not, with scornful thought, Deem me a scholar proud. \"Those men are right,\" they fiercely say, \"What mean your words so loud?\" Deep in my heart my sorrows lie, And none the cause may know. How should they know who never try To learn whence comes our woe?"}
