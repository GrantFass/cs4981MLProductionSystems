But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May I hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment."}
