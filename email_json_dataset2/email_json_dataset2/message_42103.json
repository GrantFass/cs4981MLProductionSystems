(Judges xi. 24). Such is the text in the Vulgate. Father de Carri\u00e8res translates: \"Do you not regard yourselves as having a right to what your god possesses?\" I do not know the force of the Hebrew text: but I perceive that, in the Vulgate, Jephthah positively recognises the right of the god Chamos, and that the French translator weakened this admission by inserting an \"according to you,\" which is not in the Latin."}
