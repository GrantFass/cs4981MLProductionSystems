The boy said, \"I am making a tope for Buddha.\" The king said, \"Very good;\" and immediately, right over the boy's tope, he proceeded to rear another, which was more than four hundred cubits high, and adorned with layers of all the precious substances. Of all the topes and temples which the travellers saw in their journeyings, there was not one comparable to this in solemn beauty and majestic grandeur. There is a current saying that this is the finest tope in Jambudv\u00eepa [4]. When the king's tope was completed, the little tope of the boy came out from its side on the south, rather more than three cubits in height."}
