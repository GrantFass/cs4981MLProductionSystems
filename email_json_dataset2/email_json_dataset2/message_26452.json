However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you may no more say, \u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 I will show how the change might be effected. If Homer had said, \u2018The priest came, having his daughter\u2019s ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the kings;\u2019 and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have been, not imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run as follows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), \u2018The priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy and return safely home, but begged that they would give him back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to him\u2014the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said\u2014she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went away in fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god,\u2019\u2014and so on. In this way the whole becomes simple narrative."}
