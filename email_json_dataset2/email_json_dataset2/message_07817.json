For inasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an object can appear to us, that is, be an object of empirical intuition, space and time are pure intuitions, which contain \u00e0 priori the condition of the possibility of objects as phenomena, and an \u00e0 priori synthesis in these intuitions possesses objective validity."}
