Their order of sequence is rather determined by the relation which they bear to one another in modern bourgeois society, and which is the exact opposite of what seems to be their natural order or the order of their historical development. What we are interested in is not the place which economic relations occupy in the historical succession of different forms of society. Still less are we interested in the order of their succession \u201cin idea\u201d (_Proudhon_), which is but a hazy (?) conception of the course of history. We are interested in their organic connection within modern bourgeois society."}
