After this king Dareios took Samos before all other cities, whether of Hellenes or Barbarians, and for a cause which was as follows:\u0097When Cambyses the son of Cyrus was marching upon Egypt, many Hellenes arrived in Egypt, some, as might be expected, joining in the campaign to make profit, 122 and some also coming to see the land itself; and among these was Syoloson the son of Aiakes and brother of Polycrates, an exile from Samos. To this Syloson a fortunate chance occurred, which was this:\u0097he had taken and put upon him a flame-coloured mantle, and was about the market-place in Memphis; and Dareios, who was then one of the spearmen of Cambyses and not yet held in any great estimation, seeing him had a desire for the mantle, and going up to him offered to buy it. Then Syloson, seeing that Dareios very greatly desired the mantle, by some divine inspiration said: \"I will not sell this for any sum, but I will give it thee for nothing, if, as it appears, it must be thine at all costs.\" To this Dareios agreed and received from him the garment."}
