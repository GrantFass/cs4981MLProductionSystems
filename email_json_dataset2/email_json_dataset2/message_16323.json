Ecclesiast. seculum ix. p. 311, &c.) He draws his original intelligence from Photius (contra Manichaeos, l. i.) and Peter Siculus, (Hist. Manichaeorum.) The first of these accounts has not fallen into my hands; the second, which Mosheim prefers, I have read in a Latin version inserted in the Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum, (tom. xvi. p. 754-764,) from the edition of the Jesuit Raderus, (Ingolstadii, 1604, in 4to.) * Note: Compare Hallam\u2019s Middle Ages, p. 461-471. Mr. Hallam justly observes that this chapter \u201cappears to be accurate as well as luminous, and is at least far superior to any modern work on the subject.\u201d\u2014M.]"}
