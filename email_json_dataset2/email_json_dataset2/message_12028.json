The parts of the mamm\u00e6 also, and the organs of generation, are different in man and in other animals. For some have the mamm\u00e6 forward on or near the breast, and two mamm\u00e6 with two nipples, as man and the elephant, as I said before, for the elephant has two mamm\u00e6 near the arm-pits; in the female they are small, and do not bear any proportion to the size of the animal, so that they are scarcely visible in a side view; the males also have mamm\u00e6 as well as the females, but they are exceedingly small."}
