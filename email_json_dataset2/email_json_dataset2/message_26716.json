When the throne was vacant by the murder of Caligula, the consuls convoked that assembly in the Capitol, condemned the memory of the C\u00e6sars, gave the watchword _liberty_ to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to their standard, and during eight-and-forty hours acted as the independent chiefs of a free commonwealth. But while they deliberated, the pr\u00e6torian guards had resolved. The stupid Claudius, brother of Germanicus, was already in their camp, invested with the Imperial purple, and prepared to support his election by arms. The dream of liberty was at an end; and the senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude. Deserted by the people, and threatened by a military force, that feeble assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the pr\u00e6torians, and to embrace the benefit of an amnesty, which Claudius had the prudence to offer, and the generosity to observe. 28"}
