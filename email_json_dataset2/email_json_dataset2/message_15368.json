This is the conception, or, if the term is preferred, the judgement, \u201cI think.\u201d But it is readily perceived that this thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general, and consequently of transcendental conceptions also, and that it is therefore regarded as a transcendental conception, although it can have no peculiar claim to be so ranked, inasmuch as its only use is to indicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness. At the same time, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions of the senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of objects. \u201cI,\u201d as thinking, am an object of the internal sense, and am called soul. That which is an object of the external senses is called body. Thus the expression, \u201cI,\u201d as a thinking being, designates the object-matter of psychology, which may be called \u201cthe rational doctrine of the soul,\u201d inasmuch as in this science I desire to know nothing of the soul but what, independently of all experience (which determines me in concreto), may be concluded from this conception \u201cI,\u201d in so far as it appears in all thought."}
