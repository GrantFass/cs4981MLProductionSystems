Consequently, numerical quantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a quantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other. Thus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I might compose and give \u00e0 priori, that is construct, the degree of our sensations of the sun-light.[30] We may therefore entitle these two principles constitutive."}
