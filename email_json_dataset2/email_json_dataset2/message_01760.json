An \u00e0 priori or non-empirical conception contains either a pure intuition\u2014and in this case it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions, which are not given \u00e0 priori. In this latter case, it may help us to form synthetical \u00e0 priori judgements, but only in the discursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means of the construction of conceptions."}
