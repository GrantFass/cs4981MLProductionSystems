What has he to do with the Path of Wisdom? To-day, when he comes to us, let us be on our guard not to speak with him.\" At the places where the five men all rose up, and respectfully saluted Buddha, when he came to them; where, sixty paces north from this, he sat with his face to the east, and first turned the wheel of the Law, converting Kaundinya and the four others; where, twenty paces further to the north, he delivered his prophecy concerning Maitreya; and where, at a distance of fifty paces to the south, the dragon El\u00e2pattra asked him, \"When shall I get free from this n\u00e2ga body?\"--at all these places topes were reared, and are still existing. In the park there are two monasteries, in both of which there are monks residing."}
