Let us now see the effect on the assemblies. When lawfully summoned, these were called _comitia_: they were usually held in the public square at Rome or in the Campus Martius, and were distinguished as _Comitia Curiata, Comitia Centuriata_, and _Comitia Tributa_, according to the form under which they were convoked. The _Comitia Curiata_ were founded by Romulus; the _Centuriata_ by Servius; and the _Tributa_ by the tribunes of the people. No law received its sanction and no magistrate was elected, save in the comitia; and as every citizen was enrolled in a _curia_, a century, or a tribe, it follows that no citizen was excluded from the right of voting, and that the Roman people was truly sovereign both _de jure_ and _de facto_."}
