And therefore they are alledged out of 1 Cor. 11.2. \"I commend you for keeping my Precepts as I delivered them to you.\" The Greek is, \"I commend you for keeping those things I delivered to you, as I delivered them.\" Which is far from signifying that they were Laws, or any thing else, but good Counsell. And that of 1 Thess. 4.2. \"You know what commandements we gave you:\" where the Greek word is paraggelias edokamen, equivalent to paredokamen, what wee delivered to you, as in the place next before alledged, which does not prove the Traditions of the Apostles, to be any more than Counsells; though as is said in the 8th verse, \"he that despiseth them, despiseth not man, but God\": For our Saviour himself came not to Judge, that is, to be King in this world; but to Sacrifice himself for Sinners, and leave Doctors in his Church, to lead, not to drive men to Christ, who never accepteth forced actions, (which is all the Law produceth,) but the inward conversion of the heart; which is not the work of Laws, but of Counsell, and Doctrine."}
