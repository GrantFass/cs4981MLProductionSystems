But the real\u2014that which corresponds to sensation\u2014in opposition to negation = 0, only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a being (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical consciousness. That is to say, the empirical consciousness in the internal sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree, so that the very same extensive quantity of intuition, an illuminated surface, for example, excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other surfaces less illuminated. We can therefore make complete abstraction of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon, and represent to ourselves in the mere sensation in a certain momentum, a synthesis of homogeneous ascension from 0 up to the given empirical consciousness, All sensations therefore as such are given only \u00e0 posteriori, but this property thereof, namely, that they have a degree, can be known \u00e0 priori. It is worthy of remark, that in respect to quantities in general, we can cognize \u00e0 priori only a single quality, namely, continuity; but in respect to all quality (the real in phenomena), we cannot cognize \u00e0 priori anything more than the intensive quantity thereof, namely, that they have a degree. All else is left to experience."}
