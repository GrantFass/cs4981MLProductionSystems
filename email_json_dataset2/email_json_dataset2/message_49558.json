From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were intrusted to their superintending care; and, like the Viziers of the East, they held with one hand the seal, and with the other the standard, of the empire. The ambition of the pr\u00befects, always formidable, and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served, was supported by the strength of the Pr\u00betorian bands; but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian, and finally suppressed by Constantine, the pr\u00befects, who survived their fall, were reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers. When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor\u00d5s person, they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace. They were deprived by Constantine of all military command, as soon as they had ceased to lead into the field, under their immediate orders, the flower of the Roman troops; and at length, by a singular revolution, the captains of the guards were transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces. According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian, the four princes had each their Pr\u00betorian pr\u00befect; and after the monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine, he still continued to create the same number of Four Pr\u00befects, and intrusted to their care the same provinces which they already administered. 1. The pr\u00befect of the East stretched his ample jurisdiction into the three parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Persia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, once acknowledged the authority of the pr\u00befect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the pr\u00befect of Italy was not confined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over the additional territory of Rh\u00betia as far as the banks of the Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and those of Tingitania. 4. The pr\u00befect of the Gauls comprehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the foot of Mount Atlas. 99"}
