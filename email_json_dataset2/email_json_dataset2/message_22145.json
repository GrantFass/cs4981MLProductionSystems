But a commodity as such is a direct combination of use-value and exchange value; and it is a commodity only in relation to other commodities. The _actual_ relation between commodities constitutes the _process of their exchange_. It is a social process participated in by individuals independent of each other but the part they take in it is that of owners of commodities only. Their mutual relations are those of their commodities, and thus they really appear as conscious factors of the process of exchange."}
