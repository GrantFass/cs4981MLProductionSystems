For it is not the shape; but their use, that makes them Angels. But their use is to be significations of Gods presence in supernaturall operations; As when Moses (Exod. 33.14.) had desired God to goe along with the Campe, (as he had done alwaies before the making of the Golden Calfe,) God did not answer, \"I will goe,\" nor \"I will send an Angel in my stead;\" but thus, \"my presence shall goe with thee.\""}
