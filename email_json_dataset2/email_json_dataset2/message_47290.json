His violent menaces had extorted his readmission into the church, against which Cyprian protests with much vehemence: ne pecuni\u00e6 commiss\u00e6 sibi fraudator, ne stuprator virginum, ne matrimoniorum multorum depopulator et corruptor, ultra adhuc sponsam Christi incorruptam pr\u00e6senti\u00e6 su\u00e6 dedecore, et impudica atque incesta contagione, violaret. See Chelsum\u2019s Remarks, p. 134. If these charges against Felicissimus were true, they were something more than \u201cirregularities,\u201d A Roman censor would have been a fairer subject of comparison than a consul. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the charge of adultery deepens very rapidly as the controversy becomes more violent. It is first represented as a single act, recently detected, and which men of character were prepared to substantiate: adulterii etiam crimen accedit. quod patres nostri graves viri deprehendisse se nuntiaverunt, et probaturos se asseverarunt. Epist. xxxviii. The heretic has now darkened into a man of notorious and general profligacy. Nor can it be denied that of the whole long epistle, very far the larger and the more passionate part dwells on the breach of ecclesiastical unity rather than on the violation of Christian holiness.\u2014M.]"}
