April 12, 2007", "body": " \u2018Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and prose:\u2014\u201cVirtue,\u201d as Hesiod says, \u201cis honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable.\u201d You may often see the wicked in great prosperity and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. And mendicant prophets knock at rich men\u2019s doors, promising to atone for the sins of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and festive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or bad by divine help and at a small charge;\u2014they appeal to books professing to be written by Musaeus and Orpheus, and carry away the minds of whole cities, and promise to \u201cget souls out of purgatory;\u201d and if we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us."}
