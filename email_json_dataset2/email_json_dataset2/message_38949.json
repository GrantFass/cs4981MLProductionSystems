His country, and the public, are indebted to him for the following works on that subject: 1. _Rerum Italicarum Scriptores_, (A.D. 500\u20141500,) _quorum potissima pars nunc primum in lucem prodit_, &c., xxviii. vols. in folio, Milan, 1723\u20141738, 1751. A volume of chronological and alphabetical tables is still wanting as a key to this great work, which is yet in a disorderly and defective state. 2. _Antiquitates Itali\u00e6 Medii \u00c6vi_, vi. vols. in folio, Milan, 1738\u20141743, in lxxv. curious dissertations, on the manners, government, religion, &c., of the Italians of the darker ages, with a large supplement of charters, chronicles, &c. 3. _Dissertazioni sopra le Antiquita Italiane_, iii. vols. in 4to., Milano, 1751, a free version by the author, which may be quoted with the same confidence as the Latin text of the Antiquities. _Annali d\u2019 Italia_, xviii. vols. in octavo, Milan, 1753\u20141756, a dry, though accurate and useful, abridgment of the history of Italy, from the birth of Christ to the middle of the xviiith century. 5. _Dell\u2019 Antichita Estense ed Italiane_, ii. vols. in folio, Modena, 1717, 1740. In the history of this illustrious race, the parent of our Brunswick kings, the critic is not seduced by the loyalty or gratitude of the subject. In all his works, Muratori approves himself a diligent and laborious writer, who aspires above the prejudices of a Catholic priest. He was born in the year 1672, and died in the year 1750, after passing near 60 years in the libraries of Milan and Modena, (Vita del Proposto Ludovico Antonio Muratori, by his nephew and successor Gian. Francesco Soli Muratori Venezia, 1756 m 4to.)]"}
