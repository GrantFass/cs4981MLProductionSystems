There were two monasteries in it. Three hundred paces outside the west gate, king Aj\u00e2tasatru, having obtained one portion of the relics of Buddha, built over them a tope, high, large, grand, and beautiful. Leaving the city by the south gate, and proceeding south four li, one enters a valley, and comes to a circular space formed by five hills, which stand all round it, and have the appearance of the suburban wall of a city. Here was the old city of king Bimbis\u00e2ra; from east to west about five or six li, and from north to south seven or eight. It was here that S\u00e2riputtra and Maudgaly\u00e2yana first saw Upasena [1]; that the Nirgrantha made a pit of fire and poisoned the rice, and then invited Buddha to eat with him; that king Aj\u00e2tasatru made a black elephant intoxicated with liquor, wishing him to injure Buddha; and that at the northeast corner of the city in a large curving space J\u00eevaka built a vih\u00e2ra in the garden of \u00c2mbap\u00e2l\u00ee, and invited Buddha with his one thousand two hundred and fifty disciples to it, that he might there make his offerings to support them. These places are still there as of old, but inside the city all is emptiness and desolation; no man dwells in it."}
