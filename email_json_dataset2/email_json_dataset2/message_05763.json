For the original apperception relates to our internal sense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates \u00e0 priori to its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in time. Now this manifold must be combined in original apperception according to relations of time\u2014a necessity imposed by the \u00e0 priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjected all that can belong to my (i.e., my own) cognition, and therefore all that can become an object for me. This synthetical and \u00e0 priori determined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore the rule: \u201cAll empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of the general determination of time\u201d; and the analogies of experience, of which we are now about to treat, must be rules of this nature."}
