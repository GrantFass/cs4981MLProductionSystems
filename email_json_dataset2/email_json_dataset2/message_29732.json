These birds make their nests in a place sheltered from the wind. That which the Beotians call \u00e6rops[191] is the only bird that makes its nests in caverns in the earth. The cichl\u00e6[192] make nests of mud like swallows in the tops of trees; but they place them in order close to each other, so that from their proximity they look like a chain of nests. Among the birds which make solitary nests, the hoopoe makes no real nest, but lays its eggs in the stumps of hollow trees, without building at all. The coccyx[193] lays its eggs in houses and holes in rocks. The tetrix, which the Athenians call \"urax,\" makes no nest on the ground or in trees, but in herbaceous plants."}
