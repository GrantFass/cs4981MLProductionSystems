I have read the accounts of him in the \"Memoirs of Eminent Monks,\" compiled in A.D. 519, and a later work, the \"Memoirs of Marvellous Monks,\" by the third emperor of the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1403-1424), which, however, is nearly all borrowed from the other; and all in them that has an appearance of verisimilitude can be brought within brief compass."}
