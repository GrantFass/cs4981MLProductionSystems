But this rule of the determination of a thing according to succession in time is as follows: \u201cIn what precedes may be found the condition, under which an event always (that is, necessarily) follows.\u201d From all this it is obvious that the principle of cause and effect is the principle of possible experience, that is, of objective cognition of phenomena, in regard to their relations in the succession of time."}
