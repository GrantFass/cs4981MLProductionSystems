Per valutare \u00e8 buona la moneta ideale, cosi come la reale e forse anche pi\u00f9. L\u2019altro uso della moneta \u00e8 di comperare quelle cose istesse, ch\u2019ella apprezza ... i prezzi e i contratti si valutano in moneta ideale e si eseguiscono in moneta reale.\u201d Galiani, l. c., p. 112 sq. (\u201cMoney is of two kinds, ideal and real; and is adapted to two different uses: to determine the value of things and to buy them. For the purpose of valuation ideal money is as good as real and perhaps even better. The other use of money is to buy the same things which it appraises ... prices and contracts are determined in ideal money and are executed in real money.\u201d)"}
