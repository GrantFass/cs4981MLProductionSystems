Within the neck is the \u0153sophagus, which also derives its additional name, the isthmus, from its length and narrowness, and the trachea. The trachea lies in front of the \u0153sophagus in all animals which possess this part, that is, all animals which breathe from the lungs. The trachea is cartilaginous in its nature, and contains but little blood: it is surrounded with many smooth rings of cartilage, and it lies upon the upper part towards the mouth, opposite the passage from the nostril to the mouth, wherefore, also, if any liquid is drawn into it in drinking, it passes out of the mouth through the nostrils."}
