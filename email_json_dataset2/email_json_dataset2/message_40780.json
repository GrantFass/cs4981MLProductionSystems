Now the propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the limits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any experiment with their _objects_, as in natural science. Hence, with regard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume _\u00e0 priori_, our only course will be to view them from two different sides. We must regard one and the same conception, _on the one hand_, in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the understanding, _on the other hand_, in relation to reason, isolated and transcending the limits of experience, as an object of mere thought. Now if we find that, when we regard things from this double point of view, the result is in harmony with the principle of pure reason, but that, when we regard them from a single point of view, reason is involved in self-contradiction, then the experiment will establish the correctness of this distinction."}
