If animals have acetabula in the uterus, these acetabula always become smaller as the f\u0153tus grows, and at last disappear. The umbilical cord is a covering for veins, of which the origin is in the uterus. In those creatures which have acetabula it originates in them; in those that have not acetabula it originates in the vein. In the larger animals, such as the f\u0153tus of oxen, there are four veins; in smaller animals, two; in very small animals, as in birds, there is but one. Two veins reach the f\u0153tus through the liver, from that part called the gates of the liver, towards the great vein; and two go to the aorta, where it is divided into two parts; and there are membranes round each pair of veins, and the umbilical cord surrounds these membranes like a covering. As the f\u0153tus increases, these veins diminish. The embryo, as it grows, advances into the viscera, where its movements are manifest. Sometimes it remains rolled up near the pudendum."}
