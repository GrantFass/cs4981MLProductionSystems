I have, with pleasure, selected this remark from an author who in general seems to have disappointed the expectation of the public as a critic, and still more as a traveller. He had visited the banks of the Hellespont; and had read Strabo; he ought to have consulted the Roman itineraries. How was it possible for him to confound Ilium and Alexandria Troas, (Observations, p. 340, 341,) two cities which were sixteen miles distant from each other? * Note: Compare Walpole\u00d5s Memoirs on Turkey, v. i. p. 101. Dr. Clarke adopted Mr. Walpole\u00d5s interpretation of the salt Hellespont. But the old interpretation is more graphic and Homeric. Clarke\u00d5s Travels, ii. 70.\u00d1M.]"}
