See if you qualify..", "body": " Metaphysic, therefore\u2014that of nature, as well as that of ethics, but in an especial manner the criticism which forms the prop\u00e6deutic to all the operations of reason\u2014forms properly that department of knowledge which may be termed, in the truest sense of the word, philosophy. The path which it pursues is that of science, which, when it has once been discovered, is never lost, and never misleads. Mathematics, natural science, the common experience of men, have a high value as means, for the most part, to accidental ends\u2014but at last also, to those which are necessary and essential to the existence of humanity. But to guide them to this high goal, they require the aid of rational cognition on the basis of pure conceptions, which, be it termed as it may, is properly nothing but metaphysics."}
