From the dark valley comes a bird, And seeks the lofty tree. _Ying_ goes its voice, and thus it cries, \"Companion, come to me.\" The bird, although a creature small, Upon its mate depends; And shall we men, who rank o'er all, Not seek to have our friends? All spirits love the friendly man, And hearken to his prayer. What harmony and peace they can Bestow, his lot shall share."}
