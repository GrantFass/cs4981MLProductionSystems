How then is the subsumption of the latter under the former, and consequently the application of the categories to phenomena, possible?\u2014For it is impossible to say, for example: \u201cCausality can be intuited through the senses and is contained in the phenomenon.\u201d\u2014This natural and important question forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement, with the purpose, to wit, of showing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to phenomena. In all other sciences, where the conceptions by which the object is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneous from those which represent the object in concreto\u2014as it is given, it is quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning the application of the former to the latter."}
