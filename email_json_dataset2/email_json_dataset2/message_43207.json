On the contrary, transcendental logic has lying before it the manifold content of \u00e0 priori sensibility, which transcendental \u00e6sthetic presents to it in order to give matter to the pure conceptions of the understanding, without which transcendental logic would have no content, and be therefore utterly void. Now space and time contain an infinite diversity of determinations of pure \u00e0 priori intuition, but are nevertheless the condition of the mind\u2019s receptivity, under which alone it can obtain representations of objects, and which, consequently, must always affect the conception of these objects. But the spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined after a certain manner, received into the mind, and connected, in order afterwards to form a cognition out of it. This Process I call synthesis."}
