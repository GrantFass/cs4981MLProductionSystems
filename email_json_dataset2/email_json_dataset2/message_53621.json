These appointed two, Joseph the Just, and Matthias (ver. 23.) and caused lots to be drawn; \"and (ver. 26.) the Lot fell on Matthias and he was numbred with the Apostles.\" So that here we see the ordination of this Apostle, was the act of the Congregation, and not of St. Peter, nor of the eleven, otherwise then as Members of the Assembly."}
