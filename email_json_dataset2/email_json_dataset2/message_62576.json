Rather more than ten li to the northeast of the city, he found the vih\u00e2ra in the park of \"The rishi's Deer-wild.\" [1] In this park there formerly resided a Pratyeka Buddha, with whom the deer were regularly in the habit of stopping for the night. When the World-honored one was about to attain to perfect Wisdom, the devas sang in the sky, \"The son of king Suddhodana, having quitted his family and studied the Path of Wisdom, will now in seven days become Buddha.\" The Pratyeka Buddha heard their words, and immediately attained to nirv\u00e2na; and hence this place was named \"The Park of the rishi's Deer-wild.\" After the World-honored one had attained to perfect Wisdom, men built the vih\u00e2ra in it."}
