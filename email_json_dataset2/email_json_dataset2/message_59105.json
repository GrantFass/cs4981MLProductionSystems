And often rulers and their subjects may come in one another\u2019s way, whether on a journey or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger\u2014for where danger is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich\u2014and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh\u2014when he sees such an one puffing and at his wits\u2019-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another \u2018Our warriors are not good for much\u2019?"}
