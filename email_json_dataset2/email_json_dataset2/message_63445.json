And the fish called rhyades,[149] when the washings of fish or of f\u0153tid drains are emptied into the water, make their escape as if smelling the f\u0153tid odour. They say that fish soon smell the blood of their own kind; this is plain from their hastening from any place where the blood of fishes may be. On the whole, if any one use a putrid bait, the fish will not come near it; but if a fresh strong-smelling bait is used, they will come to it from a great distance."}
