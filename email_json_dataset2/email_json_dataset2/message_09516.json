The cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily attribute to things \u00e0 priori all the properties which constitute conditions under which alone we can cogitate them. Now I cannot obtain the least representation of a thinking being by means of external experience, but solely through self-consciousness. Such objects are consequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness of mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking beings. The proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d is, in the present case, understood in a problematical sense, not in so far as it contains a perception of an existence (like the Cartesian \u201cCogito, ergo sum\u201d), but in regard to its mere possibility\u2014for the purpose of discovering what properties may be inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject of it."}
