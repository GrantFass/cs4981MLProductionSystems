To put it in his own confused language, during certain periods when all commodities are unsaleable there are really more buyers than sellers of one commodity, _money_, and more sellers than buyers of _all other money_, commodities; such was, e. g., the case at certain moments during the commercial crisis of 1857-58 in London and Hamburg. The metaphysical balance of purchases and sales amounts to this, that every purchase is a sale and every sale is a purchase, which is a poor consolation to the guardian of the commodity who can not bring about its sale and therefore can not buy.[71]"}
