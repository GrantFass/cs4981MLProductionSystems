In the same number of days after conception the discharge no longer takes its usual course, but is turned towards the mamm\u00e6, in which the milk begins to make its appearance. At first the milk appears very small, and like a web in the mamm\u00e6. After conception, the first sensation generally takes place in the iliac region, which immediately appears more full in some persons. This is more conspicuous in slight persons. If the child is a male, a movement is usually felt on the right side of the groin, in about forty days; if a female, the movement occurs on the left side, in about ninety days. We must not suppose, however, that an accurate judgment can be formed in this way, for it often happens that the movement is felt on the right side when a female child, and on the left when a male child is conceived. All these, and such like things, vary in a greater or less degree."}
