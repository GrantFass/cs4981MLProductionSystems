In most birds the stomach is fleshy and thick, and on the outside there is a strong skin, which is separated from the fleshy part. Some birds have no crop, but instead of it a wide \u0153sophagus, either wholly so, or in the part extending to the stomach, as in the col\u0153us,[83] raven, and crow. The quail has the lower part of the \u0153sophagus broad, the \u00e6gocephalus has it small but wider, and so has the owl. But the duck, goose, gull, diver, and bustard, have a wide and broad \u0153sophagus, and so have many other birds."}
