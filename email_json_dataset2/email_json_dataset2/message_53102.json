This relation was, however, merely theoretical, imaginary. It becomes real only in the process of exchange. On the other hand, a commodity _is_ an exchange value in so far as a certain quantity of labor-time has been expended on it, and it consequently represents _materialized labor-time_. But of itself it is only materialized individual labor-time of a particular kind, and not _universal_ labor-time. Therefore, it _is not_ directly an exchange value, but must first _become_ such. First of all, it is an embodiment of universal labor-time only in so far as it represents labor-time applied to a definite useful purpose, i. e., when it represents a use-value. This was the material condition under which alone labor-time contained in commodities was regarded as universal social labor. Thus, while a commodity can become a use-value only after it has been realized as an exchange value, it can, on the other hand, be realized as an exchange value only if it proves to be a use-value in the process of alienation."}
