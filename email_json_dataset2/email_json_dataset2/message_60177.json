On this necessity \u00e0 priori is also founded the possibility of apodeictic principles of the relations of time, or axioms of time in general, such as: \u201cTime has only one dimension,\u201d \u201cDifferent times are not coexistent but successive\u201d (as different spaces are not successive but coexistent). These principles cannot be derived from experience, for it would give neither strict universality, nor apodeictic certainty. We should only be able to say, \u201cso common experience teaches us,\u201d but not \u201cit must be so.\u201d They are valid as rules, through which, in general, experience is possible; and they instruct us respecting experience, and not by means of it."}
