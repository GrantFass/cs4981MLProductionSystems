Opposed to this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only \u00e0 posteriori, that is, through experience. Knowledge \u00e0 priori is either pure or impure. Pure knowledge \u00e0 priori is that with which no empirical element is mixed up. For example, the proposition, \u201cEvery change has a cause,\u201d is a proposition \u00e0 priori, but impure, because change is a conception which can only be derived from experience."}
