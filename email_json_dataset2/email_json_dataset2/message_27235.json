In this last form it falls out of the sphere of circulation into that of consumption. The entire process of circulation C\u2015M\u2015C thus includes the combined series of metamorphoses, which every single commodity undergoes in order to become a direct use-value to its possessor. The first metamorphosis is accomplished in the first phase of the circulation process, C\u2015M; the second in the last phase, M\u2015C; and the entire process constitutes the _curriculum vitae_ of the commodity. But the process C\u2015M\u2015C represents the combined metamorphosis of a single commodity and constitutes at the same time the sum of certain one-sided metamorphoses of other commodities, since every metamorphosis of the first commodity constitutes its transformation into another commodity and therefore the transformation of the other commodity into it; hence it constitutes a twofold transformation which takes place at the same stage of circulation. We must then consider separately each of the two processes of exchange into which circulation C\u2015M\u2015C breaks up."}
