On the other hand, the reality of the object of our internal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clear immediately through consciousness. The former\u2014external objects in space\u2014might be a mere delusion, but the latter\u2014the object of my internal perception\u2014is undeniably real. They do not, however, reflect that both, without question of their reality as representations, belong only to the genus phenomenon, which has always two aspects, the one, the object considered as a thing in itself, without regard to the mode of intuiting it, and the nature of which remains for this very reason problematical, the other, the form of our intuition of the object, which must be sought not in the object as a thing in itself, but in the subject to which it appears\u2014which form of intuition nevertheless belongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object."}
