Either it may have to _determine_ the conception of the object\u2014which must be supplied extraneously, or it may have to _establish its reality_. The former is _theoretical_, the latter _practical_, rational cognition. In both, the _pure_ or _\u00e0 priori_ element must be treated first, and must be carefully distinguished from that which is supplied from other sources. Any other method can only lead to irremediable confusion."}
