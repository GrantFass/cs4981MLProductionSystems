In this case the distinction between a progressus in infinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety. For, although when we say, \u201cProduce a straight line,\u201d it is more correct to say in indefinitum than in infinitum; because the former means, \u201cProduce it as far as you please,\u201d the second, \u201cYou must not cease to produce it\u201d; the expression in infinitum is, when we are speaking of the power to do it, perfectly correct, for we can always make it longer if we please\u2014on to infinity. And this remark holds good in all cases, when we speak of a progressus, that is, an advancement from the condition to the conditioned; this possible advancement always proceeds to infinity. We may proceed from a given pair in the descending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate a never-ending line of descendants from it. For in such a case reason does not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does not presuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely as conditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile)."}
