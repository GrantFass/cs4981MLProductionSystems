Towards the end of the last section of it, after a reference to his travels, his labors in translation at Kin-ling (another name for Nanking), in conjunction with Buddha-bhadra, are described. In the second section we find \"A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms\"--with a note, saying that it was the work of \"the Sramana, F\u00e2-hien\"; and again, we have \"Narrative of F\u00e2-hien in two Books,\" and \"Narrative of F\u00e2-hien's Travels in one Book.\" But all these three entries may possibly belong to different copies of the same work, the first and the other two being in separate subdivisions of the catalogue."}
