Similar words are applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when the questioning spirit is stirred within him:\u2014\u2018If because I do evil, Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?\u2019 In this both Plato and Kheyam rise above the level of many Christian (?) theologians. The first definition of justice easily passes into the second; for the simple words \u2018to speak the truth and pay your debts\u2019 is substituted the more abstract \u2018to do good to your friends and harm to your enemies.\u2019 Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of life for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of philosophy. We may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. The \u2018interrogation\u2019 of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of Homer; the conclusion that the maxim, \u2018Do good to your friends and harm to your enemies,\u2019 being erroneous, could not have been the word of any great man, are all of them very characteristic of the Platonic Socrates."}
