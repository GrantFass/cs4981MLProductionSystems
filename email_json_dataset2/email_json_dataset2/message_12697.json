In all animals the spleen is naturally situated on the left side. The case has occurred that an animal having been opened, has been observed to have the spleen on the right side and the liver on the left, but such appearances are considered ominous. In all animals the trachea reaches to the lungs (its nature will be described in another place); and the \u0153sophagus, in all that have this part, reaches to the stomach through the diaphragm. For most fishes (as I observed before) have no \u0153sophagus, but the stomach is united directly with the mouth. So that it often happens that, when great fishes are pursuing small ones, the stomach falls forward into the mouth."}
