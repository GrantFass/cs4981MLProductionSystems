If we desire an example from the sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If we cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the proposition, \u201cEvery change must have a cause,\u201d will amply serve our purpose. In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause so plainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an effect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume, from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes; and the habit thence originating of connecting representations\u2014the necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective. Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing \u00e0 priori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and consequently prove their existence \u00e0 priori. For whence could our experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one, therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first principles. But, for the present, we may content ourselves with having established the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure \u00e0 priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the proper tests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity."}
