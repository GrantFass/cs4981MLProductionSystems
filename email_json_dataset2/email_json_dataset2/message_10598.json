Man is himself a phenomenon. His will has an empirical character, which is the empirical cause of all his actions. There is no condition\u2014determining man and his volition in conformity with this character\u2014which does not itself form part of the series of effects in nature, and is subject to their law\u2014the law according to which an empirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist. For this reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous origination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world of experience. But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which it determines the will is always preceded by some other state determining it. For reason is not a phenomenon, and therefore not subject to sensuous conditions; and, consequently, even in relation to its causality, the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason, nor can the dynamical law of nature, which determines the sequence of time according to certain rules, be applied to it."}
