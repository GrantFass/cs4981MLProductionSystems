The series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive synthesis itself, and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in itself\u2014given prior to all regress. Hence I am compelled to say: \u201cThe aggregate of parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finite nor infinite; and these parts are given only in the regressive synthesis of decomposition\u2014a synthesis which is never given in absolute completeness, either as finite, or as infinite.\u201d The same is the case with the series of subordinated causes, or of the conditioned up to the unconditioned and necessary existence, which can never be regarded as in itself, and in its totality, either as finite or as infinite; because, as a series of subordinate representations, it subsists only in the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previously to this regress, or as a self-subsistent series of things."}
