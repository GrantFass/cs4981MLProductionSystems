Severus was declared emperor on the banks of the Danube, either at Carnuntum, according to Spartianus, (Hist. August. p. 65,) or else at Sabaria, according to Victor.

A little intermediate village seems to indicate by its name (Altenburg) the site of an old town. D\u2019Anville Geogr. Anc. Sabaria, now Sarvar.\u2014G. Compare note 37.\u2014M.]"}
