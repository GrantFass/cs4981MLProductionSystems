The human female and the mare copulate after conception more than any other creatures, for all other females, when they have conceived, fly from the males, except those which, like the hare, become pregnant a second time during gestation. But the mare, having once conceived, does not form a second f\u0153tus, but generally produces a single foal. In the human subject it happens sometimes, though rarely. Those which are conceived a long while afterwards never come to perfection, but, from the pain which they cause, destroy the original f\u0153tus; and a case has occurred in which twelve imperfect embryos have been produced at one time. If the second conception take place soon after the first, they bear and produce the f\u0153tus, as if it were a twin. This, they say, was the case with Iphicles and Hercules."}
