But having been worsted in the encounter, those of them who were taken alive worked wearing the fetters which they themselves brought with them and having \"measured with line and divided\" 79 the plain of the Tegeans. And these fetters with which they had been bound were preserved even to my own time at Tegea, hanging about the temple of Athene Alea. 80"}
