(mess_id: qn67129975369)", "body": " This conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if we admit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that there exists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions. In such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have no choice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the absolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of the possibility of things. But if there exists no motive for coming to a definite conclusion, and we may leave the question unanswered till we have fully weighed both sides\u2014in other words, when we are merely called upon to decide how much we happen to know about the question, and how much we merely flatter ourselves that we know\u2014the above conclusion does not appear to be so great advantage, but, on the contrary, seems defective in the grounds upon which it is supported."}
