It was saved by a series of great princes, who derived their obscure origin from the martial provinces of Illyricum. Within a period of about thirty years, Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his colleagues, triumphed over the foreign and domestic enemies of the state, re\u00ebstablished, with the military discipline, the strength of the frontiers, and deserved the glorious title of Restorers of the Roman world."}
