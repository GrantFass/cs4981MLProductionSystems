It is remarkable that Gibbon should fall into this error, for Hyde himself does not ascribe the Sadder to Zoroaster; he remarks that it is written inverse, while Zoroaster always wrote in prose. Hyde, i. p. 27. Whatever may be the case as to the latter assertion, for which there appears little foundation, it is unquestionable that the Sadder is of much later date. The Abb\u00e9 Foucher does not even believe it to be an extract from the works of Zoroaster. See his Diss. before quoted. Mem. de l\u2019Acad. des Ins. t. xxvii.\u2014G. Perhaps it is rash to speak of any part of the Zendavesta as the writing of Zoroaster, though it may be a genuine representation of his. As to the Sadder, Hyde (in Pr\u00e6f.) considered it not above 200 years old. It is manifestly post-Mahometan. See Art. xxv. on fasting.\u2014M.]"}
