For if the objects to which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them synthetically \u00e0 priori. But they are nothing but phenomena; a complete knowledge of which\u2014a knowledge to which all principles \u00e0 priori must at last relate\u2014is the only possible experience. It follows that these principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena. But this synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis in general, the category contains the function unrestricted by any sensuous condition. These principles will therefore authorize us to connect phenomena according to an analogy, with the logical and universal unity of conceptions, and consequently to employ the categories in the principles themselves; but in the application of them to experience, we shall use only their schemata, as the key to their proper application, instead of the categories, or rather the latter as restricting conditions, under the title of \u201cformulae\u201d of the former."}
