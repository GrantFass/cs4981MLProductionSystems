By far the best treatment is to be found in Mr. Bernard Bosanquet's _Philosophical Theory of the State_. Viscount Morley's _Rousseau_ is a good life, but is not of much use as a criticism of views; Mr. W. Boyd's _The Educational Theory of Rousseau_ contains some fairly good chapters on the political views. D. G. Ritchie's _Darwin and Hegel_ includes an admirable essay on _The Social Contract Theory_ and another on _Sovereignty._ The English translation of Professor Gran's _Rousseau_ is an interesting biography."}
