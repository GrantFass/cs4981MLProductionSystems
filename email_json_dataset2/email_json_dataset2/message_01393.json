We can, however, lay at the foundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itself perfectly contentless representation \u201ci\u201d which cannot even be called a conception, but merely a consciousness which accompanies all conceptions. By this \u201cI,\u201d or \u201cHe,\u201d or \u201cIt,\u201d who or which thinks, nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought = x, which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its predicates, and of which, apart from these, we cannot form the least conception. Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must always employ it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it. And this inconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of, because consciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing a particular object, as a form of representation in general, in so far as it may be termed cognition; for in and by cognition alone do I think anything."}
