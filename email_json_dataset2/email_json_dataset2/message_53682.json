The proposition is that the object of the internal sense, the thinking Ego, is an absolute simple substance. Without at present entering upon this subject\u2014as it has been considered at length in a former chapter\u2014I shall merely remark that, if something is cogitated merely as an object, without the addition of any synthetical determination of its intuition\u2014as happens in the case of the bare representation, I\u2014it is certain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a representation. As, moreover, the predicates whereby I cogitate this object are merely intuitions of the internal sense, there cannot be discovered in them anything to prove the existence of a manifold whose parts are external to each other, and, consequently, nothing to prove the existence of real composition. Consciousness, therefore, is so constituted that, inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same time its own object, it cannot divide itself\u2014although it can divide its inhering determinations. For every object in relation to itself is absolute unity. Nevertheless, if the subject is regarded externally, as an object of intuition, it must, in its character of phenomenon, possess the property of composition. And it must always be regarded in this manner, if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in it a manifold whose parts are external to each other."}
