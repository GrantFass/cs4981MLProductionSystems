If, on the other hand, we disengage it from the chain, and cogitate it as an intelligible being, apart from the series of natural causes\u2014how shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter from the former? All laws respecting the regress from effects to causes, all synthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possible experience and the objects of the sensuous world, and, apart from them, are without significance."}
