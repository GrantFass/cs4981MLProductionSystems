[letter id: 34591460778]", "body": " From V\u00e2r\u00e2nas\u00ee the travellers went back east to P\u00e2taliputtra. F\u00e2-hien's original object had been to search for copies of the Vinaya. In the various kingdoms of North India, however, he had found one master transmitting orally the rules to another, but no written copies which he could transcribe. He had therefore travelled far and come on to Central India. Here, in the mah\u00e2y\u00e2na monastery, he found a copy of the Vinaya, containing the Mah\u00e2s\u00e2nghik\u00e2 [1] rules--those which were observed in the first Great Council, while Buddha was still in the world. The original copy was handed down in the Jetavana vih\u00e2ra. As to the other eighteen schools, each one has the views and decisions of its own masters. Those agree with this in the general meaning, but they have small and trivial differences, as when one opens and another shuts. This copy of the rules, however, is the most complete, with the fullest explanations. [2]"}
