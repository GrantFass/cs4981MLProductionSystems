He would never allow education of some kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of Solon, \u2018I grow old learning many things,\u2019 cannot be applied literally. Himself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and delighting in solid geometry (Rep.), he has no difficulty in imagining that a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits. We who know how many more men of business there are in the world than real students or thinkers, are not equally sanguine. The education which he proposes for his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of genius, interrupted, but only for a time, by practical duties,\u2014a life not for the many, but for the few."}
