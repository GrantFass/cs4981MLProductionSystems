For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we are wont to say, that this or that may be known \u00e0 priori, because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience. Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, \u201che might know \u00e0 priori that it would have fallen;\u201d that is, he needed not to have waited for the experience that it did actually fall. But still, \u00e0 priori, he could not know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently, that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known to him previously, by means of experience."}
