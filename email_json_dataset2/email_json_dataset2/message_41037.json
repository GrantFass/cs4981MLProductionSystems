The anthren\u00e6[178] and wasps form cells for their progeny when they have no rulers, but are wandering about in search of them, the anthren\u00e6 upon some high place, the wasps in holes. But when they have the rulers they form their cells underground. All their cells are hexagonal, like those of bees; they are not formed of wax, but of a web-like membrane, made of the bark of trees. The cells of the anthren\u00e6 are far more elegant than those of wasps. Upon the side of their cells they place their progeny, in the manner of the bees, like a drop of liquid united to the wall of the cell. The progeny in all the cells is not alike, but in some they are so large as to be almost ready for flight, in others are nymph\u00e6, in others grubs."}
