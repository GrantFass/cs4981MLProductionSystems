Courage may be defined as a sort of salvation\u2014the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and education have prescribed concerning dangers. You know the way in which dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or of any other colour. Colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no soap or lye will ever wash them out. Now the ground is education, and the laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out. This power which preserves right opinion about danger I would ask you to call \u2018courage,\u2019 adding the epithet \u2018political\u2019 or \u2018civilized\u2019 in order to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which may hereafter be discussed."}
