If you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits, then they grow angry; they are charming people. \u2018Charming,\u2014nay, the very reverse.\u2019 Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the state which is like them. And such states there are which first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution, and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything; and he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour. \u2018Yes, the men are as bad as the states.\u2019 But do you not admire their cleverness? \u2018Nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the people tell them.\u2019 And when all the world is telling a man that he is six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe anything else? But don\u2019t get into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the Hydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. Minute enactments are superfluous in good states, and are useless in bad ones."}
