Most Editors translate, \"Moreover Ariamnes... contributed to the fate of the Phenicians, being a friend (of the Ionians);\" but this does not seem possible unless we read {philos eon Iosi} (or {Ionon}). Valla translates nearly as I have done. (It does not appear that {prosballesthai} is found elsewhere in the sense of {sumballesthai}.)]"}
