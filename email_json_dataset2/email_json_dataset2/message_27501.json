Those insects which have teeth are omnivorous, but those which have a tongue only live upon fluids, which they collect from all sources with this organ. Some of these are omnivorous, for they feed upon all kinds of fluids, as the fly. Others only suck blood, as the myops and \u0153strus. Others, again, live upon the juices of plants and fruit. The bee is the only insect that never touches anything putrid. It uses no food that has not a sweet taste. They also take very sweet water, wherever they fall upon any that is pure.
