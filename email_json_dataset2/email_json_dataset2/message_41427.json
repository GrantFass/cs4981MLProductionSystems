When Buddha, on his return entered the vihara, this image immediately left its place, and came forth to meet him. Buddha said to it, \"Return to your seat. After I have attained to pari-nirv\u00e2na, you will serve as a pattern to the four classes of my disciples,\" [4] and on this the image returned to its seat. This was the very first of all the images of Buddha, and that which men subsequently copied. Buddha then removed, and dwelt in a small vihara on the south side of the other, a different place from that containing the image, and twenty paces distant from it."}
