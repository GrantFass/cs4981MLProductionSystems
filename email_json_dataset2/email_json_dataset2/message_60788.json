We shall, accordingly, show that the mathematical method is unattended in the sphere of philosophy by the least advantage\u2014except, perhaps, that it more plainly exhibits its own inadequacy\u2014that geometry and philosophy are two quite different things, although they go hand in hand in the field of natural science, and, consequently, that the procedure of the one can never be imitated by the other."}
