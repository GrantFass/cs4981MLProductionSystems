But the assertion that objects and the understanding by which they are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematic unity, that this may be postulated \u00e0 priori, without any reference to the interest of reason, and that we are justified in declaring all possible cognitions\u2014empirical and others\u2014to possess systematic unity, and to be subject to general principles from which, notwithstanding their various character, they are all derivable such an assertion can be founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason, which would render this systematic unity not subjectively and logically\u2014in its character of a method, but objectively necessary."}
