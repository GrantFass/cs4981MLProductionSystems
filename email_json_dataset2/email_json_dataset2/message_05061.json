The dolphin, whale, and other cetacea which have a blow-hole but no gills, are viviparous, and so are the pristis and the bos. For none of these have an ovum, but a proper f\u0153tus, from which, when perfected, an animal is developed, as in man and the viviparous quadrupeds. The dolphin usually produces one, and sometimes two young ones. The whale generally and usually produces two and sometimes one. The phoc\u00e6na is similar to the dolphin, for it is like a small dolphin. It is produced in the Pontus. In some respects the phoc\u00e6na differs from the dolphin, for its size is smaller, it is wider in the back, and its colour is blue. Many persons say that the phoc\u00e6na is a kind of dolphin."}
