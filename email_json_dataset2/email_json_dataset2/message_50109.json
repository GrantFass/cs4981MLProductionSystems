North of the city so named is a large forest, having in it the double-galleried vih\u00e2ra where Buddha dwelt, and the tope over half the body of \u00c2nanda. Inside the city the woman \u00c2mbap\u00e2l\u00ee [1] built a vih\u00e2ra in honor of Buddha, which is now standing as it was at first. Three li south of the city, on the west of the road, is the garden which the same \u00c2mbap\u00e2l\u00ee presented to Buddha, in which he might reside. When Buddha was about to attain to his pari-nirv\u00e2na, as he was quitting the city by the west gate, he turned round, and, beholding the city on his right, said to them, \"Here I have taken my last walk.\" Men subsequently built a tope at this spot."}
