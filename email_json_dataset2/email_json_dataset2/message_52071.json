At the request of his friends, he reduced a work of 30,000 sheets to a more reasonable size. But his Arabic original is known only by the Persian and Turkish versions. The Saracenic history of Ebn Amid, or Elmacin, is said to be an abridgment of the great Tabari, (Ockley\u2019s Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. preface, p. xxxix. and list of authors, D\u2019Herbelot, p. 866, 870, 1014.)]"}
