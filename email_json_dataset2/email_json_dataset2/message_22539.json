The Kingdome therefore of God, is a reall, not a metaphoricall Kingdome; and so taken, not onely in the Old Testament, but the New; when we say, \"For thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and Glory,\" it is to be understood of Gods Kingdome, by force of our Covenant, not by the Right of Gods Power; for such a Kingdome God alwaies hath; so that it were superfluous to say in our prayer, \"Thy Kingdome come,\" unlesse it be meant of the Restauration of that Kingdome of God by Christ, which by revolt of the Israelites had been interrupted in the election of Saul. Nor had it been proper to say, \"The Kingdome of Heaven is at hand,\" or to pray, \"Thy Kingdome come,\" if it had still continued."}
