It enables us to see that the proofs of the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistries\u2014are not fallacious, but grounded on the nature of reason, and valid\u2014under the supposition that phenomena are things in themselves. The opposition of the judgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the initial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the true constitution of objects of sense. This transcendental dialectic does not favour scepticism, although it presents us with a triumphant demonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method, the great utility of which is apparent in the antinomy, where the arguments of reason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force. And although the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we expected\u2014although we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to metaphysical science\u2014we have still reaped a great advantage in the correction of our judgements on these subjects of thought."}
