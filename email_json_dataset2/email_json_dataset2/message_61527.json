For both of these Plato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of Book IV, which fall unperceived on the reader\u2019s mind, as they are supposed at first to have fallen on the ear of Glaucon and Adeimantus. The \u2018paradoxes,\u2019 as Morgenstern terms them, of this book of the Republic will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the style, and some explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added."}
