In that demonstration, it was taken for granted that the world is a thing in itself\u2014given in its totality prior to all regress, and a determined position in space and time was denied to it\u2014if it was not considered as occupying all time and all space. Hence our conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the antithesis the actual infinity of the world."}
