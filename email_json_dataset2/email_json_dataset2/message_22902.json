Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determined \u00e0 priori in such a manner that the rule of its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this \u00e0 priori intuition in every empirical example. But the existence of phenomena cannot be known \u00e0 priori, and although we could arrive by this path at a conclusion of the fact of some existence, we could not cognize that existence determinately, that is to say, we should be incapable of anticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be distinguishable from that of others."}
