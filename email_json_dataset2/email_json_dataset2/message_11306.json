The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of their synthesis\u2014in its progress by means of composition, as well as by division. And the world is termed nature,[49] when it is regarded as a dynamical whole\u2014when our attention is not directed to the aggregation in space and time, for the purpose of cogitating it as a quantity, but to the unity in the existence of phenomena. In this case the condition of that which happens is called a cause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is termed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense a natural cause. The conditioned in existence is termed contingent, and the unconditioned necessary. The unconditioned necessity of phenomena may be called natural necessity."}
