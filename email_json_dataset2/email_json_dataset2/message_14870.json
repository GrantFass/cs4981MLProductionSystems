For it is a necessary condition of every cognition that is to be established upon _\u00e0 priori_ grounds that it shall be held to be absolutely necessary; much more is this the case with an attempt to determine all pure _\u00e0 priori_ cognition, and to furnish the standard\u2014and consequently an example\u2014of all apodeictic (philosophical) certitude. Whether I have succeeded in what I professed to do, it is for the reader to determine; it is the author\u2019s business merely to adduce grounds and reasons, without determining what influence these ought to have on the mind of his judges. But, lest anything he may have said may become the innocent cause of doubt in their minds, or tend to weaken the effect which his arguments might otherwise produce\u2014he may be allowed to point out those passages which may occasion mistrust or difficulty, although these do not concern the main purpose of the present work. He does this solely with the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts which might affect his judgement of the work as a whole, and in regard to its ultimate aim."}
