For the metaphysic of nature is completely different from mathematics, nor is it so rich in results, although it is of great importance as a critical test of the application of pure understanding\u2014cognition to nature. For want of its guidance, even mathematicians, adopting certain common notions\u2014which are, in fact, metaphysical\u2014have unconsciously crowded their theories of nature with hypotheses, the fallacy of which becomes evident upon the application of the principles of this metaphysic, without detriment, however, to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of cognition."}
