The eagle and the dragon are enemies, for the eagle feeds on serpents. The ichneumon and the spider are also enemies, for the ichneumon hunts the spider. Among birds the p\u0153cilis and the lark and the wood-pecker and chloreus are enemies, for they eat each others' eggs. The crow and the owl also are enemies; for at mid-day the crow, taking advantage of the dim sight of the owl, secretly seizes and devours its eggs, and the owl eats those of the crow during the night; and one of these is master during the day, the other during the night. The owl and orchilus are enemies; for the latter eats the eggs of the owl. During the day other birds fly round the owl, which is called \"astonishing it,\" and as they fly round it pluck off its feathers. For this reason fowlers use it in hunting for all kinds of birds."}
