This name may, however, be also given to the whole system of pure philosophy, critical philosophy included, and may designate the investigation into the sources or possibility of \u00e0 priori cognition, as well as the presentation of the \u00e0 priori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophy\u2014excluding, at the same time, all empirical and mathematical elements."}
