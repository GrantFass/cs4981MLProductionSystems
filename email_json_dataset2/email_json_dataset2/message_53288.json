At the sight of the arms of the Ambraciots from the city, the herald was astonished at their number, knowing nothing of the disaster and fancying that they were those of their own party. Some one asked him what he was so astonished at, and how many of them had been killed, fancying in his turn that this was the herald from the troops at Idomene. He replied: \u201cAbout two hundred\u201d; upon which his interrogator took him up, saying: \u201cWhy, the arms you see here are of more than a thousand.\u201d The herald replied: \u201cThen they are not the arms of those who fought with us?\u201d The other answered: \u201cYes, they are, if at least you fought at Idomene yesterday.\u201d \u201cBut we fought with no one yesterday; but the day before in the retreat.\u201d \u201cHowever that may be, we fought yesterday with those who came to reinforce you from the city of the Ambraciots.\u201d When the herald heard this and knew that the reinforcement from the city had been destroyed, he broke into wailing and, stunned at the magnitude of the present evils, went away at once without having performed his errand, or again asking for the dead bodies. Indeed, this was by far the greatest disaster that befell any one Hellenic city in an equal number of days during this war; and I have not set down the number of the dead, because the amount stated seems so out of proportion to the size of the city as to be incredible. In any case I know that if the Acarnanians and Amphilochians had wished to take Ambracia as the Athenians and Demosthenes advised, they would have done so without a blow; as it was, they feared that if the Athenians had it they would be worse neighbours to them than the present."}
