The same indulgence was granted to accused Christians, in the persecution of Decius: and Cyprian (de Lapsis) expressly mentions the \u00d2Dies negantibus pr\u00bestitutus.\u00d3 * Note: The examples drawn by the historian from Justin Martyr and Cyprian relate altogether to particular cases, and prove nothing as to the general practice adopted towards the accused; it is evident, on the contrary, from the same apology of St. Justin, that they hardly ever obtained delay. \u00d2A man named Lucius, himself a Christian, present at an unjust sentence passed against a Christian by the judge Urbicus, asked him why he thus punished a man who was neither adulterer nor robber, nor guilty of any other crime but that of avowing himself a Christian.\u00d3 Urbicus answered only in these words: \u00d2Thou also hast the appearance of being a Christian.\u00d3 \u00d2Yes, without doubt,\u00d3 replied Lucius. The judge ordered that he should be put to death on the instant. A third, who came up, was condemned to be beaten with rods. Here, then, are three examples where no delay was granted.\u00d1\u00d1[Surely these acts of a single passionate and irritated judge prove the general practice as little as those quoted by Gibbon.\u00d1M.] There exist a multitude of others, such as those of Ptolemy, Marcellus, &c. Justin expressly charges the judges with ordering the accused to be executed without hearing the cause. The words of St. Cyprian are as particular, and simply say, that he had appointed a day by which the Christians must have renounced their faith; those who had not done it by that time were condemned.\u00d1G. This confirms the statement in the text.\u00d1M.]"}
