The change from plants to animals, however, is gradual, as I before observed. For a person might question to which of these classes some marine objects belong; for many of them are attached to the rock, and perish as soon as they are separated from it. The pinn\u00e6 are attached to the rocks, the solens cannot live after they are taken away from their localities; and, on the whole, all the testacea resemble plants, if we compare them with locomotive animals. Some of them appear to have no sensation; in others it is very dull.
