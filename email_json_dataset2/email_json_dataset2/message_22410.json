That the I or Ego of apperception, and consequently in all thought, is singular or simple, and cannot be resolved into a plurality of subjects, and therefore indicates a logically simple subject\u2014this is self-evident from the very conception of an Ego, and is consequently an analytical proposition. But this is not tantamount to declaring that the thinking Ego is a simple substance\u2014for this would be a synthetical proposition. The conception of substance always relates to intuitions, which with me cannot be other than sensuous, and which consequently lie completely out of the sphere of the understanding and its thought: but to this sphere belongs the affirmation that the Ego is simple in thought. It would indeed be surprising, if the conception of \u201csubstance,\u201d which in other cases requires so much labour to distinguish from the other elements presented by intuition\u2014so much trouble, too, to discover whether it can be simple (as in the case of the parts of matter)\u2014should be presented immediately to me, as if by revelation, in the poorest mental representation of all."}
