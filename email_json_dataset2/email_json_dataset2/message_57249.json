About this period, also, the f\u0153tus becomes divided; it previously existed as an undivided mass of flesh. If it perishes within seven days, it is called an effluxion; if in forty days, an abortion. The f\u0153tus often perishes within this period. If the male f\u0153tus is excluded within forty days, and is put out into any other fluid, it becomes dissolved, and disappears. If placed in cold water, it becomes, as it were, surrounded with a membrane. When this is taken off, the f\u0153tus appears about as large as a large ant. Its parts are visible, both those of generation, and all the rest; and the eyes are very large, as in other animals. If the female f\u0153tus perishes within the three months, it generally appears without divisions. If it survives to the fourth month, the parts appear formed."}
