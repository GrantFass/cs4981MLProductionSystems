Check out our girls", "body": " In the first place, the following proposition is evident, and indubitably certain: \u201cIf the conditioned is given, a regress in the series of all its conditions is thereby imperatively required.\u201d For the very conception of a conditioned is a conception of something related to a condition, and, if this condition is itself conditioned, to another condition\u2014and so on through all the members of the series. This proposition is, therefore, analytical and has nothing to fear from transcendental criticism. It is a logical postulate of reason: to pursue, as far as possible, the connection of a conception with its conditions."}
