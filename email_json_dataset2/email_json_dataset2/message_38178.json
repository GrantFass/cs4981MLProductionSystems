The statesmen of the French Revolution, from Robespierre downwards, were throughout profoundly affected by the study of his works. Though they seem often to have misunderstood him, they had on the whole studied him with the attention he demands. In the nineteenth century, men continued to appeal to Rousseau, without, as a rule, knowing him well or penetrating deeply into his meaning. \"The _Social Contract_,\" says M. Dreyfus-Brisac, \"is the book of all books that is most talked of and least read.\" But with the great revival of interest in political philosophy there has come a desire for the better understanding of Rousseau's work. He is again being studied more as a thinker and less as an ally or an opponent; there is more eagerness to sift the true from the false, and to seek in the _Social Contract_ the \"principles of political right,\" rather than the great revolutionary's _ipse dixit_ in favour of some view about circumstances which he could never have contemplated."}
