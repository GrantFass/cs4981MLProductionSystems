The logical principle of genera, accordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objects presented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle. In accordance with this principle, homogeneity is necessarily presupposed in the variety of phenomena (although we are unable to determine \u00e0 priori the degree of this homogeneity), because without it no empirical conceptions, and consequently no experience, would be possible."}
