The raven is an enemy to the bull and ass, for it flies round them and strikes their eyes. The eagle and the heron are foes, for the eagle has crooked claws and attacks it, and the other dies in defending itself. The \u00e6salon is a foe to the vulture, and the crex to the coleus, blackbird, and chlorion, which some persons fabulously say derives its origin from a funeral pile, for it destroys both themselves and their young.
