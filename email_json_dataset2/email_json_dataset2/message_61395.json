If it gave us any information in respect to the former statement, it would be a constitutive principle\u2014a principle impossible from the nature of pure reason. It will not therefore enable us to establish any such conclusions as: \u201cThe series of conditions for a given conditioned is in itself finite,\u201d or, \u201cIt is infinite.\u201d For, in this case, we should be cogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality, an object which is not and cannot be given in experience; inasmuch as we should be attributing a reality objective and independent of the empirical synthesis, to a series of phenomena. This idea of reason cannot then be regarded as valid\u2014except as a rule for the regressive synthesis in the series of conditions, according to which we must proceed from the conditioned, through all intermediate and subordinate conditions, up to the unconditioned; although this goal is unattained and unattainable. For the absolutely unconditioned cannot be discovered in the sphere of experience."}
