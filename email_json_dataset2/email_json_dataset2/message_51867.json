When conception has taken place, the uterus usually closes immediately for seven months. In the eighth month it opens, and the f\u0153tus, if properly developed, begins to descend in the eighth month. If the f\u0153tus is not properly developed, but checked in the eighth month in parturition, women who bear in the eighth month do not exclude it, nor does the f\u0153tus advance downwards in the eighth month, and the uterus does not open itself. It is a sign that it is not properly developed, when it is born before the circumstances I have described take place."}
