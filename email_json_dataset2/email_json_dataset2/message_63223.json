They will say: \u2018Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.\u2019 And certainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. \u2018And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?\u2019 And we shall reply: Of course they do. Then we shall be asked, \u2018Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?\u2019 Certainly they should. \u2018But if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?\u2019\u2014What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?"}
