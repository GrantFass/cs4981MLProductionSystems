A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented \u00e0 priori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their quality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the homogeneous), by means of number. But the matter of phenomena, by which things are given in space and time, can be presented only in perception, \u00e0 posteriori. The only conception which represents \u00e0 priori this empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing in general; and the \u00e0 priori synthetical cognition of this conception can give us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may be contained in the corresponding \u00e0 posteriori perception; it is utterly inadequate to present an \u00e0 priori intuition of the real object, which must necessarily be empirical."}
