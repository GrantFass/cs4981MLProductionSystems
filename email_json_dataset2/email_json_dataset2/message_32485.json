I was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in states, when Polemarchus\u2014he was sitting a little farther from me than Adeimantus\u2014taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said something in an undertone, of which I only caught the words, \u2018Shall we let him off?\u2019 \u2018Certainly not,\u2019 said Adeimantus, raising his voice. Whom, I said, are you not going to let off? \u2018You,\u2019 he said. Why? \u2018Because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula that friends have all things in common.\u2019 And was I not right? \u2018Yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018but there are many sorts of communism or community, and we want to know which of them is right. The company, as you have just heard, are resolved to have a further explanation.\u2019 Thrasymachus said, \u2018Do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to hear you discourse?\u2019 Yes, I said; but the discourse should be of a reasonable length. Glaucon added, \u2018Yes, Socrates, and there is reason in spending the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without more ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out, and how the interval between birth and education is to be filled up.\u2019 Well, I said, the subject has several difficulties\u2014What is possible? is the first question. What is desirable? is the second. \u2018Fear not,\u2019 he replied, \u2018for you are speaking among friends.\u2019 That, I replied, is a sorry consolation; I shall destroy my friends as well as myself. Not that I mind a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a murderer. \u2018Then,\u2019 said Glaucon, laughing, \u2018in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us.\u2019"}
