The conditions of this doctrine are\u2014inasmuch as it must, as a synthesis according to rules, be conformable to the understanding, and at the same time as the absolute unity of the synthesis, to the reason\u2014that, if it is adequate to the unity of reason, it is too great for the understanding, if according with the understanding, it is too small for the reason.
