For, if some of the moderns have thought to enlarge its domain by introducing _psychological_ discussions on the mental faculties, such as imagination and wit, _metaphysical_, discussions on the origin of knowledge and the different kinds of certitude, according to the difference of the objects (idealism, scepticism, and so on), or _anthropological_ discussions on prejudices, their causes and remedies: this attempt, on the part of these authors, only shows their ignorance of the peculiar nature of logical science. We do not enlarge but disfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limits and allow them to run into one another. Now logic is enclosed within limits which admit of perfectly clear definition; it is a science which has for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the _formal_ laws of all thought, whether it be _\u00e0 priori_ or empirical, whatever be its origin or its object, and whatever the difficulties\u2014natural or accidental\u2014which it encounters in the human mind."}
