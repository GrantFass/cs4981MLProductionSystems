The village of Aspalathus, 120 and, long afterwards, the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins. The Golden Gate now opens into the market-place. St. John the Baptist has usurped the honors of \u00c6sculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under the protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church."}
