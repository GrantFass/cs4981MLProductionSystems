The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms."}
