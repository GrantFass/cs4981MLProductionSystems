The _analysis_ of the metaphysician separates pure cognition _\u00e0 priori_ into two heterogeneous elements, viz., the cognition of things as phenomena, and of things in themselves. _Dialectic_ combines these again into harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, and finds that this harmony never results except through the above distinction, which is, therefore, concluded to be just."}
