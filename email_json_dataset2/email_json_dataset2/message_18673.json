Authorities are to be weighed, not excluded from examination. Now, the Pagan historians justify in many places the detail which have been transmitted to us by the historians of the church, concerning the tortures endured by the Christians. Celsus reproaches the Christians with holding their assemblies in secret, on account of the fear inspired by their sufferings, \u00d2for when you are arrested,\u00d3 he says, \u00d2you are dragged to punishment: and, before you are put to death, you have to suffer all kinds of tortures.\u00d3 Origen cont. Cels. l. i. ii. vi. viii. passing. Libanius, the panegyrist of Julian, says, while speaking of the Christians. \u00d2Those who followed a corrupt religion were in continual apprehensions; they feared lest Julian should invent tortures still more refined than those to which they had been exposed before, as mutilation, burning alive, &c.; for the emperors had inflicted upon them all these barbarities.\u00d3 Lib. Parent in Julian. ap. Fab. Bib. Gr\u00bec. No. 9, No. 58, p. 283\u00d1G. \u00d1\u00d1This sentence of Gibbon has given rise to several learned dissertation: M\u0161ller, de Fide Eusebii C\u00besar, &c., Havni\u00be, 1813. Danzius, de Eusebio C\u00bes. Hist. Eccl. Scriptore, ejusque tide historica recte \u00bestimand\u2030, &c., Jen\u00be, 1815. Kestner Commentatio de Eusebii Hist. Eccles. conditoris auctoritate et fide, &c. See also Reuterdahl, de Fontibus Histori\u00be Eccles. Eusebian\u00be, Lond. Goth., 1826. Gibbon\u00d5s inference may appear stronger than the text will warrant, yet it is difficult, after reading the passages, to dismiss all suspicion of partiality from the mind.\u00d1M.]"}
