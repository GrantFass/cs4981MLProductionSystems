The king, who sincerely reverenced him, wished and begged him to come and live in his family, where he could supply all his wants. The other, however, through his delight in the stillness of the mountain, was unwilling to accept the invitation, on which the king said to him, \"Only accept my invitation, and I will make a hill for you inside the city.\" Accordingly, he provided the materials of a feast, called to him the spirits, and announced to them, \"Tomorrow you will all receive my invitation; but as there are no mats for you to sit on, let each one bring his own seat.\" Next day the spirits came, each one bringing with him a great rock, like a wall, four or five paces square, for a seat. When their sitting was over, the king made them form a hill with the large stones piled on one another, and also at the foot of the hill, with five large square stones, to make an apartment, which might be more than thirty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and more than ten cubits high."}
