And if there be any man here, overjoyed at being chosen to command, who urges you to make the expedition, merely for ends of his own\u2014specially if he be still too young to command\u2014who seeks to be admired for his stud of horses, but on account of its heavy expenses hopes for some profit from his appointment, do not allow such a one to maintain his private splendour at his country\u2019s risk, but remember that such persons injure the public fortune while they squander their own, and that this is a matter of importance, and not for a young man to decide or hastily to take in hand."}
