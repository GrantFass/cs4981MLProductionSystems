In most birds the stomach is fleshy and thick, and on the outside there is a strong skin, which is separated from the fleshy part. Some birds have no crop, but instead of it a wide \u0153sophagus, either wholly so, or in the part extending to the stomach, as in the col\u0153us,[83] raven, and crow.
