These birds make their nests in a place sheltered from the wind. That which the Beotians call \u00e6rops[191] is the only bird that makes its nests in caverns in the earth. The cichl\u00e6[192] make nests of mud like swallows in the tops of trees; but they place them in order close to each other, so that from their proximity they look like a chain of nests. Among the birds which make solitary nests, the hoopoe makes no real nest, but lays its eggs in the stumps of hollow trees, without building at all.
