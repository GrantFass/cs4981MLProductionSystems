Very small white cancri are produced in some of the testacea, especially in the my\u00e6 that inhabit muddy places, and next to this in the pinn\u00e6 those which are called pinnoter\u00e6; they occur also in the pectens and limnostrea. These animals apparently never grow; and the fishermen say that they are produced at the same time as the creatures they inhabit. The pectens disappear for some time in the sand, and so do the purpur\u00e6. The ostrea (bivalves) are produced in the manner described, for some of them originate in shallow water, others near the shore, or among rocks, or in rough hard places, or in sand; and some have the power of locomotion, others have not."}
