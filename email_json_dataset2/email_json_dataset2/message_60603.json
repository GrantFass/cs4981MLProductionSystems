Some viviparous animals are internally oviparous, as the selache; others are internally viviparous, as mankind and the horse. In different animals the f\u0153tus assumes a different form, when first brought into the world, and is either a living creature, an egg, or a worm. The eggs of some animals, as birds, are hard-shelled, and are of two colours. Those of the selache and some other animals are soft-skinned, and have only one colour. Some species of the vermiform f\u0153tus are capable of motion, others are not. But in another place, when we treat of generation, we will dwell more accurately on these subjects."}
