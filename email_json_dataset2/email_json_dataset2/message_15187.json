This principle might have been expressed as follows: \u201cAll alteration (succession) of phenomena is merely change\u201d; for the changes of substance are not origin or extinction, because the conception of change presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite determinations, and consequently as permanent. After this premonition, we shall proceed to the proof.)"}
