The bones of animals depend upon one bone, and are connected with each other, like the veins; and there is no such thing as a separate bone. In all animals with bones the spinal column is their origin. The spinal column is made up of vertebr\u00e6, and extends from the head to the hips. All the vertebr\u00e6 are perforated; the upper part of the head is a bone joined to the last vertebra, and is called the skull, the saw-like part is the suture."}
