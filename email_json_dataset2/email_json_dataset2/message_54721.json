The king of this country, having obtained one portion of the relics of Buddha's body, returned with it and built over it a tope, named the R\u00e2ma tope. By the side of it there was a pool, and in the pool a dragon, which constantly kept watch over the tope, and presented offerings at it day and night. When king Asoka came forth into the world, he wished to destroy the eight topes over the relics, and to build instead of them eighty-four thousand topes. [1] After he had thrown down the seven others, he wished next to destroy this tope. But then the dragon showed itself, and took the king into its palace; when he had seen all the things provided for offerings, it said to him, \"If you are able with your offerings to exceed these, you can destroy the tope, and take it all away. I will not contend with you.\" The king, however, knew that such appliances for offerings were not to be had anywhere in the world, and thereupon returned without carrying out his purpose."}
