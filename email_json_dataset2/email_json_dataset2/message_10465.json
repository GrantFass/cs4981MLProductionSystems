[For all those are called and considered tyrants, who hold perpetual power in a State that has known liberty.] It is true that Aristotle (_Nicomachean Ethics_, Book viii, chapter x) distinguishes the tyrant from the king by the fact that the former governs in his own interest, and the latter only for the good of his subjects; but not only did all Greek authors in general use the word _tyrant_ in a different sense, as appears most clearly in Xenophon's _Hiero_, but also it would follow from Aristotle's distinction that, from the very beginning of the world, there has not yet been a single king."}
