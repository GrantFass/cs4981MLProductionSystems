Motion, for example, presupposes the perception of something movable. But space considered in itself contains nothing movable, consequently motion must be something which is found in space only through experience\u2014in other words, an empirical datum. In like manner, transcendental \u00e6sthetic cannot number the conception of change among its data \u00e0 priori; for time itself does not change, but only something which is in time. To acquire the conception of change, therefore, the perception of some existing object and of the succession of its determinations, in one word, experience, is necessary."}
