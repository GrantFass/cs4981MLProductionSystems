About the Sauromatai the following tale is told:\u0097When the Hellenes had fought with the Amazons,\u0097now the Amazons are called by the Scythians Oiorpata, 108 which name means in the Hellenic tongue \"slayers of men,\" for \"man\" they call oior, and pata means \"to slay,\"\u0097then, as the story goes, the Hellenes, having conquered them in the battle at the Thermodon, were sailing away and conveying with them in three ships as many Amazons as they were able to take prisoners. These in the open sea set upon the men and cast them out of the ships; but they knew nothing about ships, nor how to use rudders or sails or oars, and after they had cast out the men they were driven about by wave and wind and came to that part of the Maiotian lake where Cremnoi stands; now Cremnoi is in the land of the free Scythians. 109 There the Amazons disembarked from their ships and made their way into the country, and having met first with a troop of horses feeding they seized them, and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians."}
