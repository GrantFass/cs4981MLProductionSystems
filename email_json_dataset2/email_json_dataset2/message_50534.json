See his \u201cEssay concerning the multiplication of mankind, etc.,\u201d 3rd edition, 1686, p. 35-36. He not only brings out the advantages of the division of labor on the example of the manufacture of a watch, as Adam Smith did later on that of a needle, but considers also a city and an entire country from the point of view of a large manufacturing establishment. The Spectator, of November 26, 1711, refers to this \u201cillustration of the admirable Sir William Petty.\u201d McCulloch is, therefore, mistaken when he supposes that the Spectator confounded Petty with a writer forty years his junior. See McCulloch, \u201cThe Literature of Political Economy, a classified catalogue,\u201d London, 1845, p. 105. Petty is conscious of being the founder of a new science. His method, he says, \u201cis not yet very usual, for instead of using only comparative and superlative Words, and intellectual Arguments,\u201d he has undertaken to speak \u201cin Terms of Number, Weight or Measure; to use only Arguments of Sense, and to consider only such Causes, as have visible Foundations in Nature; leaving those that depend upon the mutable Minds, Opinions, Appetites, and Passions of particular Men, to the Consideration of others.\u201d (Political Arithmetick, etc., London, 1699. Preface.) (A new edition of \u201cThe Economic Writings of Sir William Petty,\u201d edited by Chas. Henry Hull, has been published by the University Press at Cambridge, 1899. The above passage will be found in vol. I., p. 244. The further references are given to this new, more accessible edition. Translator.) His wonderful keenness shows itself e. g. in the proposal to transport \u201call the moveables and people of Ireland, and of the Highlands of Scotland ... into the rest of Great Britain.\u201d Thereby much labor-time would be saved, the productivity of labor increased, and \u201cthe King and his Subjects would thereby become more Rich and Strong.\u201d (Political Arithmetick, ch. 4, p. 285.) Or in the chapter of his Political Arithmetic in which he proves that England\u2019s mission is the conquest of the world\u2019s market at a time when Holland still played the leading part as a trading nation and France seemed to be on the way of becoming the ruling trading Power: \u201cThat the King of England\u2019s Subjects, have Stock competent and convenient, to drive the Trade of the whole Commercial World\u201d (l. c., ch. 10, p. 311). \u201cThat the Impediments of England\u2019s greatness are but contingent and removable\u201d (l. c., ch. 5, p. 298). A singular humor pervades all his writings. Thus, he shows that it was by material means that Holland\u2015at that time the model country with English economists, just as England is with continental economists to-day\u2015conquered the world market \u201cwithout such Angelical Wits and Judgments, as some attribute to the Hollanders\u201d (l. c., p. 258). He advocates \u201cLiberty of Conscience\u201d as a condition of trade, because \u201cDissenters ... are ... patient Men, and such as believe that Labour and Industry is their Duty towards God,\u201d and \u201cThey believe that ... for those who have less Wealth, to think they have the more Wit and Understanding, especially of the things of God which they think chiefly belong to the Poor.\u201d \u201cFrom whence it follows that Trade is not fixt to any species of Religion as such; but rather ... to the Heterodox part of the whole\u201d (l. c., p. 262-264). He advocates an \u201callowance by Publick Tax\u201d for those \u201cwho live by begging, cheating, stealing, gaming, borrowing without intention of restoring,\u201d because \u201cit were more for the publick profit\u201d to tax the country for such persons \u201cthan to suffer them to spend extravagantly, at the only charge of careless, credulous, and good natured People\u201d (p. 269-270). But he is opposed to taxes which transfer the wealth from industrious people \u201cto such as do nothing at all, but eat and drink, sing, play, and dance; nay such as study the Metaphysicks\u201d (ibid.). Petty\u2019s writings are rarities of the bookseller\u2019s trade and are to be found only in scattered poor old editions, which is the more surprising since William Petty was not only the father of English Political Economy, but also the ancestor of Henry Petty, alias Marquis of Lansdowne, the nestor of the English Whigs. However, the Lansdowne family could hardly bring out a complete edition of Petty\u2019s works without prefacing it with his biography, and what can be said of most origins of the great Whig families holds good also in this case, viz., \u201cthe less said of them the better.\u201d The keen-witted but cynical army surgeon who was as ready to plunder in Ireland under the shield of Cromwell as to crawl before Charles II. to get the title of baron which he needed for his plunderings, is a model hardly fit for public exhibition. Besides that, Petty seeks to prove in most of his writings which he published in his lifetime, that England\u2019s prosperity reached its climax under Charles II., a heterodox view for the hereditary exploiters of the \u201cglorious revolution.\u201d"}
