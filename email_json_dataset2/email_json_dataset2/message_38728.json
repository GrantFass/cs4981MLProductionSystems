The mya also deposits nidamental capsules; those which are called limnostrea are the first to originate in muddy places, but the conch\u00e6, chem\u00e6, solens, and pectens find their subsistence in sandy shores; the pinn\u00e6 grow up from their byssus both in sandy and muddy shores. The pinn\u00e6 always contain a pinnophylax, either like a small caris or cancer, and soon die when this is extracted. On the whole, all the testacea are produced spontaneously in mud different kinds originating in different sorts of mud: the ostrea is found in mud, the conch\u00e6 and others that have been mentioned in sand. The tethya, balanus, and others which live on the surface, as the patella and nerita, originate in holes in the rocks. All these reach maturity very soon, especially the purpur\u00e6 and pectens, for they are matured in one year."}
