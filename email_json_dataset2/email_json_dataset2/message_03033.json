The oreus (mule) mounts and copulates after shedding the first teeth, and when seven years old is able to engender; and the ginnus is produced when he mounts upon a mare. After this he no longer continues to copulate. The female oreus also has been impregnated, but the f\u0153tus has never been known to come to maturity. The hemioni (female mules) of Syria, near Ph\u0153nicia, admit the male and procreate. The kind, however, though similar, is not the same. Those which are called ginni are produced from a mare, when the f\u0153tus has received some injury in the uterus, like dwarfs among men and metach\u0153ra among swine; and the ginnus, like the dwarf, has a large genital organ."}
