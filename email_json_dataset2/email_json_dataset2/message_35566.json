Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of the relations of things, but a pure intuition. For, in the first place, we can only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers spaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, these parts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated only as existing in it. Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space, depends solely upon limitations. Hence it follows that an \u00e0 priori intuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all our conceptions of space. Thus, moreover, the principles of geometry\u2014for example, that \u201cin a triangle, two sides together are greater than the third,\u201d are never deduced from general conceptions of line and triangle, but from intuition, and this \u00e0 priori, with apodeictic certainty."}
