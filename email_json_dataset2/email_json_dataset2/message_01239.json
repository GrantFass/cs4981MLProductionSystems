The former contains all the pure rational principles\u2014based upon conceptions alone (and thus excluding mathematics)\u2014of all theoretical cognition; the latter, the principles which determine and necessitate \u00e0 priori all action. Now moral philosophy alone contains a code of laws\u2014for the regulation of our actions\u2014which are deduced from principles entirely \u00e0 priori. Hence the metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy, as it is not based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations. The metaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysic in the more limited sense. But as pure moral philosophy properly forms a part of this system of cognition, we must allow it to retain the name of metaphysic, although it is not requisite that we should insist on so terming it in our present discussion."}
