The evidence for its authenticity and genuineness is all that could be required. It is clear to myself that the \"Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms\" and the \"Narrative of his Travels by F\u00e2-hien\" were designations of one and the same work, and that it is doubtful whether any larger work on the same subject was ever current. With regard to the text subjoined to my translation, it was published in Japan in 1779. The editor had before him four recensions of the narrative; those of the Sung and Ming dynasties, with appendices on the names of certain characters in them; that of Japan; and that of Corea. He wisely adopted the Corean text, published in accordance with a royal rescript in 1726, so far as I can make out; but the different readings of the other texts are all given in top-notes, instead of foot-notes as with us, this being one of the points in which customs in the East and West go by contraries. Very occasionally, the editor indicates by a single character, equivalent to \"right\" or \"wrong,\" which reading in his opinion is to be preferred."}
