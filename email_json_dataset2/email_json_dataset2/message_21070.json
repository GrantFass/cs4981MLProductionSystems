After this, since they had directed their march towards the first of the divisions, the Persians continued to pursue towards the East and the river Tana\u00efs; and when the Scythians crossed over the river Tana\u00efs, the Persians crossed over after them and continued still to pursue, until they had passed quite through the land of the Sauromatai and had come to that of the Budinoi."}
