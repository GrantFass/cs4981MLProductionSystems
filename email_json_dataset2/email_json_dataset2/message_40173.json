Some fish produce ova at all seasons of the year, as the mur\u00e6na: for this fish produces many ova, and the fry rapidly increase in size, as do those also of the hippurus,[162] for these, from being very small, rapidly increase to a great size; but the mur\u00e6na produces young at all seasons, the hippurus in the spring. The smyrus differs from the mur\u00e6na, for the mur\u00e6na is throughout variegated and weak. The smyrus is of one colour, and strong; its colour is that of the pine tree, and it has teeth both internally and externally. They say that these are the male and the female, as in others. These creatures go upon the land, and are often taken."}
