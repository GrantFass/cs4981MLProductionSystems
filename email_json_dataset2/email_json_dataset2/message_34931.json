The choice of his detestable hero, C\u00e6sar Borgia, clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between the teaching of the _Prince_ and that of the _Discourses on Livy_ and the _History of Florence_ shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The Court of Rome sternly prohibited his book. I can well believe it; for it is that Court it most clearly portrays."}
