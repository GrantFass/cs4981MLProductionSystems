For, if we change it into an abstract principle, and deprive it of its reference to experience and the empirical, we shall find that it cannot with justice be regarded any longer as a synthetical proposition, and that it is impossible to discover any mode of transition from that which exists to something entirely different\u2014termed cause. Nay, more, the conception of a cause likewise that of the contingent\u2014loses, in this speculative mode of employing it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaning are comprehensible from experience alone."}
