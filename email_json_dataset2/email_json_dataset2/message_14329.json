The Romans.\u2014The laws of Rome were not less express and severe. The intolerance of foreign religions reaches, with the Romans, as high as the laws of the twelve tables; the prohibitions were afterwards renewed at different times. Intolerance did not discontinue under the emperors; witness the counsel of M\u00e6cenas to Augustus. This counsel is so remarkable, that I think it right to insert it entire. \u201cHonor the gods yourself,\u201d says M\u00e6cenas to Augustus, \u201cin every way according to the usage of your ancestors, and compel others to worship them. Hate and punish those who introduce strange gods, not only for the sake of the gods, (he who despises them will respect no one,) but because those who introduce new gods engage a multitude of persons in foreign laws and customs. From hence arise unions bound by oaths and confederacies, and associations, things dangerous to a monarchy.\u201d Dion Cass. l. ii. c. 36. (But, though some may differ from it, see Gibbon\u2019s just observation on this passage in Dion Cassius, ch. xvi. note 117; impugned, indeed, by M. Guizot, note in loc.)\u2014M."}
