For the principle of the former enounces, not that things themselves or substances, but only that which happens or their states\u2014as empirically contingent, have a cause: the assertion that the existence of substance itself is contingent is not justified by experience, it is the assertion of a reason employing its principles in a speculative manner. If, again, I infer from the form of the universe, from the way in which all things are connected and act and react upon each other, the existence of a cause entirely distinct from the universe\u2014this would again be a judgement of purely speculative reason; because the object in this case\u2014the cause\u2014can never be an object of possible experience. In both these cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in the field of experience\u2014useless and even meaningless beyond this region, would be diverted from its proper destination."}
