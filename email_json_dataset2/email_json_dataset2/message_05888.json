Some fish are gregarious and friendly together, others that are less gregarious are hostile. Some are gregarious while they are pregnant, others during the season of parturition. On the whole, the following are gregarious: the tunny, m\u0153nis, cobius, box, saurus, coracinus, sinodon, trigla, mur\u00e6ena, anthia, eleginus, atherinus, sarginus, belona, (mecon,) teuthus, iulus, pelamis, scombrus, and colias. Some of these are both gregarious, and live in pairs, for all the others pair together; and some are gregarious at particular seasons, as it has been said, while they are pregnant, and others in the season of depositing their ova."}
